Grey's Anatomy is a series about the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, the hospital staff and their patients. Throughout the series we meet new doctors, some leave, some return. Thousands of patients come into the hospital needing care from the best doctors in the world. Behind the scenes of the hospital (or not so much), love affairs, friendships and family relations evolve.
