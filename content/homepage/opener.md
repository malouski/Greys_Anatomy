Grey's Anatomy is a series about the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, the hospital staff and their patients. Throughout the series we meet new doctors - some leave, some return. Thousands of patients come into the hospital needing care from the best doctors in the world. Behind the scenes of the hospital (or not so much), love affairs, friendships and family relations evolve. It can be difficult to keep track of the relations between all the characters and remember what happend in which episodes. This project aims at equipping the reader with a nice overview of the most important information about episodes and characters in Grey's Anatomy as well as discovering fun and non-obvious facts. The show is especially well fit for the purpose, since it currently counts 18 seasons with 391 episodes in total and anyone who has seen the show knows that there's plenty of drama.

Let's map it out and get the overview we have all been waiting for.

#### The data

We are using the [fandom wikipage for Grey's Anatomy](https://greysanatomy.fandom.com/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy_Universe_Wiki) to collect information on all the characters in the series. The information from these pages are used to create the network and character attributes. Data on episode views and ratings are obtained from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grey%27s_Anatomy_episodes) and [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/) respectively. Furthermore, episode transcripts are obtained from [foreverdreaming.org](https://foreverdreaming.org).
