##### Romantic relationships

Grey's Anatomy is a medical drama with a strong emphasis on *drama* and it's not all *medical*. There are many romantic affairs at the hospital - some are getting married and having children while others are using the operating rooms for more than operating... In order to give you an idea of the ever-changing relationships we've made a network animation showing the romantic connections of each season. To keep it manageable, only the main characters are shown.

Point proven! We've showed you that there are plenty of relationships to explore, so how can we do that? Community analysis!

##### Communities

We find **17** communities in the network by using the Louvain algorithm. The communities are visualized below, now each character's node is coloured by their community!

<div align="center">
    <iframe src="communities.html" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=620px height=620px
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0"
     ></iframe>
</div>

We generally observe that there are always two larger nodes with the same colour i.e. they are in the same communities, and then many smaller nodes with that colour as well. For example, Meredith and Derek are in the same community (<span style="color:#6b6ecf">purple</span>) and happens to also be married. Miranda Bailey and Ben Warren are also in the same community (<span style="color:#1f77b4">blue</span>) and married. Mark Sloan and Lexie Grey are in the same community (<span style="color:#bcbd22">green</span>) and were also in a relationship. Aha!
