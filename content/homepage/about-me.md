##### Romantic relationships

Grey's Anatomy is a medical drama with a strong emphasis on *drama* and it's not all *medical*. There are many romantic affairs at the hospital - some are getting married and having children while others are using the operating rooms for more than operating... In order to give you an idea of the ever-changing relationships we've made a network animation showing the romantic connections of each season. To keep it manageable, only the main characters are shown.
