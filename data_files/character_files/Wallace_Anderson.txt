Not wanting to accept this, the Andersons, Richard, and Larry pressured Arizona into\u00a0performing\u00a0a\u00a0very risky surgery to extend Wallace's life for 2 months, which went against her better judgment. Wallace survived the surgery. However, complications set in after and he was brought back into the OR, but died of septic shock.\n\nHis body was seen later, when Arizona took his parents to the morgue to view him. Although she could not save him, his parents agreed to donate the $25 million in gratitude of Arizona's efforts, not Larry's \"ass kissing.\"\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis parents couldn't accept the reality that he was going to die and pushed [[Arizona Robbins]] to find another solution to keep him alive for longer, even if only for a few more months, but the surgery failed and he died on the table. When he died, his parents were devastated.\n\n===Professional===\nHe got along well with [[Arizona Robbins]], his doctor. She helped him with his math and science homework by letting him go on rounds with her.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He shares a birthday with [[Arizona Robbins]].\n*He reminded [[Jill Boyd]] of her own daughter, [[Hillary Boyd]].\n*While helping Arizona with rounds, Wallace wore navy blue attending scrubs and had his own SGMW embroidered lab coat.\n*He died on his 11th birthday.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x08-3.jpg\n6x08-22.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:Wallace Anderson]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, Wallace}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
