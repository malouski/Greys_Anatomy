It gave Rick the incentive he needed to push through and keep working.\n\n===Robotic Limb===\nHe and Rick entered the robotic limb trial together. They worked on the computers getting ready together and competed to see who would be the first to go up on the actual limb. Jordan won and took a few slow steps on the leg. Then he wanted to try stairs and despite Callie and Owen's protests, he attempted to take a step up and fell. He injured his head and had to be taken into surgery. After surgery, he was in a coma. While he was comatose, Rick refused to go forward with the trial, saying he'd wait until Jordan was ready again. Even after Jordan woke up, he was unresponsive and with some encouragement, Rick went ahead with his own work on the robotic limb.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis parents were in Florida. They came up to Seattle when Jordan was injured.\n\n===Friendships===\nHis best friend is [[Rick Schultz]]. They served together and went through rehab together after each of them lost a leg. Then they joined Callie's robotic limb trial together and competed for first chance to try out the leg.\n\n==Career==\nJordan was in the US military. At some point during his service, he was injured and had to have his left leg amputated above his knee.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 22 at the time of his head injury.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x08-2.jpg\n11x08-3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carter, Jordan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
