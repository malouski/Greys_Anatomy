He was short with them, asking for the name of the inmate they were there to see and inspecting the bag of supplies they'd brought while instructing them to stand up against a wall. When [[Amanda Joseph]] came in, she helped fast-track their entry. He then had them hand over their personal effects and patted each of them down. When Arizona informed him of her prosthetic leg, he pulled up her pant leg to see it. He then gave each of them a visitor badge and sent them in.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a guard at Tri-County Hospital on the prison floor.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
