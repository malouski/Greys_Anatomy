They'd been talking to someone on Instagram whom they believed to be a young influencer who offered to teach them how to make a lot of money. They left the house in the middle of the night to meet her, but when they arrived, she wasn't there. Instead, [[Robert Corson]] grabbed them and put them in a van. He then took them back to his house and locked them in a room in the basement.\n\nJada and Shanice heard voices, which made them believe they were being rescued. They then didn't hear voices anymore, so they decided to start a fire to try to lure rescue. They started the fire and watched as it burned around them. They were finally rescued when the fire drew the attention of the firefighters outside. Sullivan and Dean decided not to wait for gear and went into the house in their street clothes. They followed the girls' voices to the basement and then to a locked door. They kicked in the door and pulled both girls out. Once they were outside, they started breathing again. When Shanice was loaded into an aid car, she explained what had happened and apologized. There was a confrontation between the cops and the others, during which Jada's mother, Joyce, was arrested, along with two firefighters. Jada and Shanice were taken to the hospital to be treated. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\nIn the ER, Shanice was treated for smoke inhalation. Her mother was told that if her chest x-ray was clear, she'd be discharged to go home.
