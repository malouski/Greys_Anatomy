He was treated in the field by [[Meredith Grey]], who then rode in on the ambulance with him. In the ER, he had asymmetrical pupils, so they ordered a head CT. While they were cleaning his head laceration, he had a tonic clonic seizure. It was prolonged, so they ordered lorazepam to stop it. However, before it could be retrieved, the seizing stopped. Because he had urinated on himself, Meredith said he'd need new sheets and a gown.\n\nAlone in the room, Meredith continued to work on him. While her back was turned, he regained consciousness and started to move. He got out of the bed. When she tried to coax him back into the bed, he pushed her into the wall. He then threw her around the room, seriously injuring her. He was then restrained and moved to another room to be treated.\n\nA few weeks after the attack, Meredith asked about Lou. They told her that he'd suffered an epidural hematoma in the accident, which caused the seizure that led to the fugue state. He had surgery and had been discharged. He then reached out and made a few requests to see Meredith, which she initially refused.\n\nLater in her recovery, Meredith agreed to meet with him. He brought her a pot of flowers and introduced her to his family. He apologized and said he'd never do anything like that if he were aware of what was going on. Meredith motioned to be moved closer to him and she reached out and grabbed his arm and held it tightly.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to a woman named Joanne.\n\n===Familial===\nHe has two daughters. Ann is ten and Kylie is six. While Meredith was examining him, he said that they were super smart. His daughters tell him he makes the worst jokes.\n\nHe was in Seattle visiting his sister.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 45 at the time of his accident.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
