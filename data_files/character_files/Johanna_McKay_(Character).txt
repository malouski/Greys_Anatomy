She was ranked first among junior golfers.\n\n===Injury===\nMarissa came into the hospital with severe lower back pain, which her pediatrician had dismissed as growing pains and soreness from playing golf. However, x-rays showed a serious misalignment in her spine. [[Callie Torres]] developed a plan that would allow for more stability, increasing her chances of not becoming paralyzed. However, [[Amelia Shepherd]] developed a conflicting plan, which gave her spine less stability, but allowed more flexibility, which would allow Marissa to continue golfing. Marissa chose Amelia's approach because she said golfing was the most important thing in her life.\n\nAmelia proceeded with the surgery, but the defect was even worse than the scans showed, so she was forced to call Callie in to do it her way. By the time Callie arrived, Marissa had no nerve function in her spine, so Callie had to work quickly to stabilize her spine to restore function. The surgery was finished and Johanna was told that she would be able to walk, even run, with physical therapy, but that she wouldn't golf again.\n\nMarissa was upset because she said golf was the only thing that clicked for her. Callie told her that she would find something else that would click for her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nJohanna's daughter is a junior golfer, which Johanna supports. When Marissa had surgery to re-align her spine and Johanna was told that Marissa wouldn't be able to golf anymore, she was upset because her daughter was great and the doctors were supposed to be great, too.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McKay, Johanna}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Johanna McKay}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
