All four of them refused to speak. Addison said she could do vaginal exams to see which of them had recently given birth, but she needed the girls' consent first and none of them gave it.\n\nDesperate to find the baby's mother, Addison checked the girls' blood types against the baby's and was able to eliminate Karen and Lisa as possibilities. She then took Shannon and Sara to see the baby, pleading with them to tell her which of them it was, so she could save the baby's life. Shannon then admitted that she's the one who'd had the baby. Addison hugged her and thanked her for telling the truth then began treatment on the baby.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mom came with her to the hospital when she was suspected of having abandoned an infant in the trash can of a high school bathroom.\n\n===Friendships===\nSara, Lisa, Karen, and Shannon are all close friends.
