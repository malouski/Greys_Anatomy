She'd been having back pain and was worried she was having contractions. Kendra was snowed in\u00a0at work, so Lesley decided to walk to the hospital, which was only four blocks away, even though Kendra told her not to. In the meantime, Kendra left work and started to drive home. She was almost there when she hit something. She thought she was on the road, but she was driving on the sidewalk and hit Lesley. She then got Lesley to the hospital, where they immediately started assessing her. Wracked with guilt, Kendra explained what had happened. She was led away by Bailey, who tried to reassure her that it was an accident. While she was gone, they worked on Lesley and were forced to deliver their daughter prematurely. As a last ditch effort, they did a thoracotomy in the ER and were able to restore normal rhythm. They then took her into surgery. After her surgery, she was stable in intensive care and their baby was in the NICU, also stable. Kendra went to see Lesley and said she'd seen their daughter and she was like Lesley.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to a woman named Lesley.\n\n===Familial===\nHer daughter was born at 32 weeks gestation after her wife was hit by a car.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x15-17.jpg\n16x15-18.jpg\n16x15-21.jpg\n16x15-48.jpg\n16x15-49.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Kendra}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
