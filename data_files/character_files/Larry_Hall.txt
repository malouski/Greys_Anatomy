When it became clear that he was going to die soon, Larry's wife, Carmen, asked to hold him. She held him and accepted that she'd never get to see him grow up. Just as she did that, a heart transplant came through and saved his life.\n\nAs a teenager, the mitral valve in his heart began to fail. Rather than going back on the donor list and waiting for a heart that he may never get, they decided to have Cristina Yang replace the valve. The surgery was unsuccessful and he was instead put on the donor list.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Carmen Hall]]====\nHe is married to Carmen Hall and they have [[Michael Hall|one son]] together.\n\n===Familial===\n====[[Michael Hall]]====\nMichael is Larry's son, who was hospitalized for a mitral valve replacement. Ultimately, the surgery could not be completed and Michael had to be put back on the transplant list.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x03-1.jpg\n10x03-3.jpg\n10x03-5.jpg\n10x03-8.jpg\n10x03-12.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hall, Larry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
