Torres]] and [[Arizona Robbins|Robbins]] that she instead wanted them to amputate her legs and fit her with prosthetics so that she could live a more normal life. Her father was adamantly opposed to the idea. However, after speaking to Arizona about her personal experience as a parent and an amputee, he understood that what was best for Alyssa was to let them amputate her legs.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\n====[[Herb Cramer]]====\nAlyssa is being raised by her single father. They seem to get along well, but they butted heads when she decided that she wanted her legs amputated to reduce her pain and give her a more normal life. She was elated when he agreed to let them do so.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cramer, Alyssa}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
