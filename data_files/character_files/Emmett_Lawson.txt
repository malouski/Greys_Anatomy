He went to the hospital, where they discovered he had a liver laceration as well as impingement of his spine. He had surgery on his abdomen first and then he was observed overnight. The next day, he had a spinal fusion, while Owen monitored his abdomen, which hadn't been able to be closed, to make sure his intestines didn't fall out. His surgery was successful and his wife was told he would be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe has been married to [[Brenda Lawson]] for twenty years. In that time, the first night he spent in the hospital was the first night they ever slept apart.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lawson, Emmett}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
