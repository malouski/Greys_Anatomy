Owen checked her out and said she was fine except she had a slightly elevated heart rate, so he called Teddy to do an EKG, though Sophie said her heart rate was probably only elevated because she found Owen attractive. She briefly touched him on his arm before remembering that you can't just touch people because of COVID. Owen told her it was okay because he was wearing protection.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe has an ex-husband.\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
