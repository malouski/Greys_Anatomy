Melanie's side of the car took all the impact. Noah came into the ER complaining of pain in his right knee. He was found to have a patella fracture, which required surgery to fix. He was stable and awake after surgery, but waiting for information on Melanie and their baby.\n\nHe was later informed that Melanie's injuries were catastrophic. Her parents waited with him in his room while the doctors took her into surgery. After she reached the triangle of death, they moved her to the ICU, where she stayed until they were ready to take her back into surgery. Unfortunately, she died during the second surgery and her baby had to be delivered. After some initial trouble breathing, the baby was stable in the NICU and Noah sat next to the incubator.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nNoah was married to [[Melanie Reynolds]] until her death. They met when he went to college in Alabama, where she lived.\n\n===Familial===\nNoah and his wife are expecting a baby when they were in the car accident. Their baby was delivered right before Melanie was pronounced dead. After some initial trouble breathing, the baby was doing well in the NICU.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He's originally from [[Seattle]].\n*He was 25 at the time of the car accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reynolds, Noah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
