He denied drug use. His abdomen was rigid and his hair was falling out. They sedated him and his BP went down. Scans revealed a hemorrhaging liver mass. They informed the parents that his symptoms were consistent with the use of anabolic steroids. The parents confronted him and he admitted that he'd been doing steroids because he wanted girls to like him and he believes they only like guys with crazy bodies. He tried to claim that he'd barely taken any, but his mother said it had been two years, since his sophomore year, as that's when he'd stopped being her boy. They took him into the OR and biopsied the mass. Pathology confirmed that he had liver cancer, but they got it all when they resected the mass. His parents were warned that it could recur if he continued to do steroids. His father insisted that he wouldn't.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhen Brian started doing steroids his sophomore year, his mother just believed that he was being a normal teenager.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 17 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Danzinger, Brian}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
