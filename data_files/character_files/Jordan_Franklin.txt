He was admitted for tests. He had fluid in his abdomen due to his liver disease that was pressing on his lung. The liver disease was caused by his frequent alcohol consumption. Izzie and Cristina did a paracentesis to drain the fluid. They were nervous about the procedure as neither of them had done one before, but they did it anyway. They drained a significant amount of fluid and then noticed that he had no pulse. They called a code, but they were unable to save him.\n\nWorried that they might have done something wrong, they did an autopsy even though they were unable to convince the family to ask for one. Bailey interrupted their autopsy, but by then, they'd discovered that his heart was enlarged. They took a sample of the grainy material inside his heart to run tests. They discovered hemochromatosis, which had caused his death and had made him sick for many years prior to then. They informed the family and mentioned that it was genetic and so his daughter, Alice, might have it. The family then agreed to sign the consent form for the autopsy.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to [[Rebecca Franklin]] until his death.\n\n===Familial===\nHis daughter, Alice, resented him heavily for his drinking. She pressured her mother not to ask for an autopsy.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Franklin, Jordan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
