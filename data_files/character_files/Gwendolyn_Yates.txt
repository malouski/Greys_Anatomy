She came to the hospital with worsening shortness of breath and edema. Maggie told her her protein deposits had caused congestive heart failure. She was also developing clots, requiring an IVC filter. She was told she'd have to remain in the ICU until a heart transplant came through. Gwen had no family after her husband had died the prior October. She had adopted a dog named Jupiter, but Jupiter got out of the house during a storm and her condition left her so exhausted she couldn't look for him.\n\nA few weeks later, Gwen had her heart transplant. Once her new heart was in, the edema resolved and her condition improved, but she told the doctors she had woken up with a headache that was worsening, so they paged neuro. A week of exams and scans were all normal, though her headaches persisted. Gwen later admitted to faking the headaches because she didn't want to go home. Gwen was ultimately discharged. As she left the hospital, Richard surprised her with her dog. He'd used the interns to call shelters and locate him. Gwen happily took Jupiter and went home.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHer husband had died less than a year prior to her hospitalization.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 51 at the time of her heart transplant.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x16-8.jpg\n17x16-9.jpg\n17x16-10.jpg\n17x16-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yates, Gwendolyn}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
