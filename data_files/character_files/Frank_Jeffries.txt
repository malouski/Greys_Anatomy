There was a complication when a seroma formed, meaning that three days after his surgery, he was in the hospital and had a tube to drain the fluid from under his skin. [[Izzie Stevens]] and [[Alex Karev]] were assigned to check on the tube and make sure the fluid was draining properly.\n\nWhen they removed the bandages, Frank asked Izzie her opinion on the pecs. She said they looked even to her and she compared the feel to Alex's pecs.\n\nWhen the time came to remove the tube from his chest, Alex allowed Izzie to do it, despite her being on probation at the time.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe has a girlfriend. He got pectoral implants because she'd joined a gym and got a trainer named Lars. His previous girlfriend had left him for a man with hair, leading Frank to get hair plugs, so he decided to be pro-active this time.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He talks about himself in the third person.\n*He referred to his new pecs as \"the twins.\"\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jeffries, Frank}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
