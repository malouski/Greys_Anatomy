Cleo blamed her because Liza had told Cleo to go on the ride so she could live vicariously through her, because she was pregnant and couldn't ride herself. While she was waiting for news on Cleo and Greg, Liza collapsed in the waiting room. An ultrasound showed a tumor on her placenta. She was taken into surgery to remove it in an attempt to delay premature delivery, but her baby, [[Jasper Simmons|Jasper]], became bradycardic, so Arizona was forced to deliver him at 29 weeks. After delivery, he was given oxygen, which stabilized him enough that Liza was able to see him for a few minutes before he was taken to the NICU.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe had a baby, [[Jasper Simmons]], alone.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe is friends with fellow residents, [[Gregory Williams]] and [[Cleo Kim]]. When Greg said they had to do more than just work all the same, they went to a carnival together, which ended poorly when the roller coaster derailed.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a second-year [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*[[Gregory Williams]] was supposed to be her birthing partner.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x07-44.jpg\n14x07-50.jpg\n14x07-56.jpg\n14x07-59.jpg\n14x07-61.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Simmons, Liza}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
