Izzie tried to take them inside, but Ahn was afraid she would be deported, so Izzie treated Ahn outside instead. She gave Ahn the stitches, and Izzie gave her a pager number and told her to come back in five days so that she could check that it had healed properly and remove the stitches.\n\n==Career==\nAhn works at a factory in America.
