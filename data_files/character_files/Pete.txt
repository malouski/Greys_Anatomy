The band followed the ambulance to the hospital to check on Colin. While Colin was being cared for, Pete led the band in an impromptu performance in the ambulance bay of the hospital. The performance was ended by Alex, who informed them that it wasn't the place and asked them to come inside and give blood if they wanted to help, which they did. That evening, while Colin was recovering, Pete stood outside the hospital and played a song on his own for Colin.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x13-7.jpg\n15x13-9.jpg\n15x13-13.jpg\n15x13-14.jpg\n15x13-15.jpg\n15x13-16.jpg\n15x13-24.jpg\n15x13-25.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
