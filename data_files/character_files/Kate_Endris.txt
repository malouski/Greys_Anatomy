After tests and a cardio consult, Gus was diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Nathan wanted to put Gus on the transplant list, but Alex wanted to try a Norwood. Because they disagreed, they talked to Gus's parents about both options. However, Nathan secretly put Gus on the transplant list before they had decided.
