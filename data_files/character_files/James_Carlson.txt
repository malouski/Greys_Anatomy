He was the man who effectively put the hospital on [[Hospital Codes#Code Black|Code Black]].\n\n==History==\n===World War II Obsession===\nHe had an interest in World War 2 era objects, successfully building a bazooka with his friend Paul. Although it didn't work at first when they lit the bazooka, he checked out the front of it, then it went off, impaling him with the projectile and seriously endangering many lives as the bomb did not detonate.\n\n===Bomb Threat===\nAt [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], he stayed under anesthesia while the bomb squad, [[Preston Burke|Burke]], and [[Hannah Davies]] all gathered around him, Hannah with her hand inside of him, trying to stop the bleeding. She ended up holding a bazooka and later on after almost breaking down, [[Meredith Grey]] took over. ''(\"[[It's the End of the World]]\")''\n\nThey figured out that the OR they were in was over the hospital's main oxygen line, so they slowly moved the gurney to another OR, where they set up and had Meredith grab the shell and pull it out of his body. Burke then stepped in to continue operating on James. He survived the surgery and his wife was informed that he'd be okay. ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nJames is married to [[Mindy Carlson]]. They have three kids together.\n\n===Friendships===\n[[Paul (It's the End of the World)|Paul]] is his best friend. They share an interest in WW2 history.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 46 at the time of the bomb activity.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n216JamesCarlson.png|[[It's the End of the World]]\n217JamesCarlson.png|[[As We Know It]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x16-10.JPG\n2x16-15.jpg\n2x17-6.JPG\n2x17-7.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{James Carlson Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carlson, James}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
