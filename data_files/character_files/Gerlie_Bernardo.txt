Bailey examined her and ordered high-flow oxygen, chest films, steroids, and Remdesivir. She spent two weeks on a ventilator.\n\nA month later, in September, Gerlie was discharged from the hospital to go home and finish recovering. She was warned not to try returning to work too soon. However, as she went to leave the hospital, she collapsed and had to be taken back inside. In October, Gerlie was still fighting her post-COVID complications in the hospital. She'd had a VATS procedure and had a pneumothorax and multifocal pneumonia. Meredith did a bronchoscope on her.\n\nOn December 24, she had to be put on ECMO. In January 2021, Meredith asked to put her on the transplant list for lungs, a request Bailey denied due to her risk of sudden death. Meredith put pressure on Bailey and she ultimately agreed to the transplant. In April 2021, they found a donor and Gerlie received her lung transplant, which was successful. Gerlie woke up after her surgery surprised to see Meredith sitting by her bedside. Meredith promised Gerlie that she wasn't going anywhere.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nShe has a good relationship with her patient, Earl. When she was hospitalized, she was eager to get back to him.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a nurse at Lakeforest Assisted Living. At her job, she'd been caring for a man named Earl for seven years.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\nShe was 37 at the time of her initial admission to the hospital.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x17-1.jpg\n17x17-2.jpg\n17x17-4.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bernardo, Gerlie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Nurses]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
