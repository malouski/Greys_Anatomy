They started seeing each other and he liked that she lived in her car and wanted her to meet his parents. She agreed to the meeting, but when he asked her to move to his college with him, she instead took off and drove her car to another state.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe dated Jo while they were in high school. When he moved on to college, she left him and moved to another state.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He and Jo took physics together.\n*Given that Jo referred to his parents as Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver in reference to them being perfect, it's likely that his last name isn't actually Cleaver and this was just a reference to \"Leave It To Beaver,\" a show which follows Beaver and the rest of the Cleaver family.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cleaver, Chris}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
