However, with a mastectomy, oophorectomy, and risky experimental biological therapy, [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] managed to save Carrie's life.\n\n===Lymphedema===\nEight years later, Carrie was suffering from lymphedema and came to [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] to have surgery to correct the problem. Bailey tried to talk her out of it. However, Carrie\u00a0remained firm in her decision, because she wanted to go on with her life and be able to hold her grandchild. She was grateful to Bailey for saving her life, but she wanted to get rid of the lymphedema.\n\nBailey told Mark and [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] that they could do the surgery, but not until they read every page of Carrie's file twice. Jackson took the file and began to read.\n\nBailey observed Carrie's surgery until Jackson asked her to leave because she was distracting him. Carrie's surgery continued and was ultimately successful.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nCarrie has a daughter, Erin, who was just starting college when Carrie was diagnosed. Bailey promised Carrie that she'd make it to her daughter's graduation. Her daughter was expecting a baby in the spring.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n8x15-1.png\n8x15-2.png\n8x15-5.png\n8x15-8.png\n8x15-15.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reisler, Carrie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
