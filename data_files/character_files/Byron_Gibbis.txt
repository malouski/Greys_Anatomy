He was febrile, tachycardic, and had a heart murmur. Winston ordered a cardiac CT and noted Osler's nodes on his hands. Byron woke up in the ER while they were examining him and tried to leave, saying he didn't want to get COVID and believed everyone in the hospital was sick. Maggie assured him he was safe and they'd get him whatever he needed to feel safe.\n\nOsler's nodes indicated endocarditis, so while he had a cardiac CT, they theorized possible causes. Winston remembered him saying he hadn't left his house since lockdown started and asked Byron about his teeth. Byron said he'd used a paper clip to get a popcorn kernel out of his teeth. He had sore gums, but he refused to go to the dentist because of the pandemic. He had a dental infection which had caused the endocarditis. The CT showed an aortic valve abscess which was almost completely blocking the valves.\n\nAs they prepared Byron for his surgery, he started to freak out and left the OR. When they found him, he was huddled in a corner, nude. They managed to convince him to return to the OR and have his surgery, telling him he'd die without it. He was later said to be stable.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nHis best friend Rory was previously healthy, but died of COVID, increasing his anxiety.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 52 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gibbis, Byron}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
