''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nHe deployed teams into the hospital to clear them. One of the members of the SWAT team was able to shoot Gary Clark, but not catch him. They continued to clear the hospital one floor at a time, evacuating patients as they went. Once the shooter was identified, Marty asked Webber about him, which prompted Webber to go into the hospital to try to find him. After Webber got Clark to shoot himself and end the massacre, Marty shook his hand. ''(\"[[Death and All His Friends]]\")''\n\n===Pacific College Shooting===\nMarty's team responded when Jared Swork opened fire on Pacific College. He was getting conflicting reports about what the shooter looked like, so he needed [[Michael Fazioli]], a cop who had shot the shooter, to tell them what he looked like so they could find him among the victims. He asked the doctors to wake him up in order to get identifying details and they were able to use his description to identify the shooter as Jared Swork. Marty then interrogated Jared's mother, [[Mrs. Swork]], trying to get information out of her. ''(\"[[Disarm]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nHe thinks very highly of [[Michael Fazioli]], a young cop. When Faz was shot in the Pacific College shooting, Marty rode to the hospital with him. ''(\"[[Disarm]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nMarty is a police chief for the Seattle Police Department.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x23MartyHancock.png|[[Sanctuary]]\n6x24MartyHancock.png|[[Death and All His Friends]]\n7x11MartyHancock.png|[[Disarm]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Marty Hancock Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hancock, Marty}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Police Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
