Nicholas had an AVM in his brain. He needed surgery to remove it to stop the bleeding. They took him into surgery, but because he was so small, they couldn't get access to remove the vessels. [[Derek Shepherd]] could only do a temporary fix.\n\nThere weren't instruments small enough to remove the AVM through his nose, so Derke and [[Mark Sloan]] started to work on developing one to help Nicholas.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Nicholas came back to the ER with a nosebleed that couldn't be stopped after an hour. They had to admit him and transfuse blood.\n\nOn New Years Eve, he was in hypovolemic shock from the blood loss and Arizona said she was going to put a tube down his throat to help him breathe. However, Derek came in and announced they'd finished the prototype, so they could take Nicholas into surgery. The instrument worked and they were able to clip the AVM. They finished his surgery just before midnight on New Year's Day.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nNicholas's parents were at the hospital with him. They were upset when they found out that the surgery hadn't worked. When the instrument was ready to repair his AVM through his nose, they eagerly signed the consent papers. After Nicholas's surgery, they stood happily beside his bed.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was six at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x10-10.jpg\n6x10-11.jpg\n6x10-12.jpg\n6x10-14.jpg\n6x10-26.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jacobson, Nicholas}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]"}}}]}}}}
