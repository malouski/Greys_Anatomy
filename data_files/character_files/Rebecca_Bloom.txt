She was 8 cm. dilated, but only at minus 3 station. They decided to monitor her and perform a c-section if descent stopped entirely. Rebecca objected to that, saying she had a natural birth plan and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] had agreed that they could try to stick to that.\n\nBy the time she was fully dilated, the baby was still only at minus 2 station. She insisted that the baby just needed more time, but the baby's heart rate was slowing with each contraction. She still wanted to continue with her birth plan.\n\nAddison allowed it, but when the baby started having late decels, she was forced to perform a crash c-section. Rebecca's baby was healthy when born and she thanked Addison.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Jeff Bloom]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband have one child, born via c-section after a long, difficult labor.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bloom, Rebecca}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
