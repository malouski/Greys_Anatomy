[[Arizona Robbins]] examined him and ran tests and said he had mild scoliosis, which was aggravated by his growth. She wasn't sure about it, but she wanted to wait before running any more tests, as they were much more invasive. She gave Andy muscle relaxants and discharged him.\n\nAndy came back into the ER later after vomiting all night because of the pain. Arizona wanted to run a 3D MRI, but Pam's insurance wouldn't cover it and [[Richard Webber]] said the hospital couldn't afford to pay for it, so he told her to discharged Andy and refer him back to his primary care physician. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\nAndy had an infection, which they treated, but wasn't the primary cause of his pain. Webber continued to refuse the 3D MRI, so Arizona sent Andy over to [[Mercy West Medical Center]] to get [[Callie Torres]] to run the scan. She did so, but the scan didn't show anything. Arizona continued to think about options and finally sat up in the middle of the night and concluded that he had a tethered spinal cord. She went to [[Derek Shepherd]] to get the scan she needed to confirm the diagnosis. Once it was confirmed, they explained the condition to Andy and Pam, much to their relief. They then took Andy into surgery to clip the cord, freeing him of pain.
