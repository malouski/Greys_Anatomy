When she was four months old, a liver became available. Because the donor was an adult, the liver was split between herself and another patient. The transplant went well, but they were unable to close because of the swelling. Stark placed a sponge to keep the pressure off her hepatic artery and took her out of surgery.\n\nThe sponge was at risk for causing infection, so it wasn't a permanent solution to keep the pressure off. Alex had the idea to use a sterilized ping pong ball, which was safer because it could stay in her body and her liver would just grow around it. Stark operated to place it and after surgery, her parents were able to see her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nLisa's parents were concerned for her safety and did research into liver transplants before Lisa's surgery so they could be prepared. They were also insistent that she be called by her name because they read it helps you bond wth the baby.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was four months old at the time of her liver transplant.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Collis, Lisa}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
