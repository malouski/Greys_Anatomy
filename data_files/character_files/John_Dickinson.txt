When they learned she'd run away from rehab, they went over to the hospital, where they found Amelia. They were confused as to how Britney had met her in the first place and she explained that it was through Leo. They hadn't known she had given birth to a baby and asked to see him immediately. After meeting Leo, they decided they wanted to take him back to the hotel with them, but Owen said he was Leo's legal guardian and wouldn't allow it. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\nWhen they came back to the house to pick up Leo to take him home with them, Owen was paged to the hospital to deal with a mass overdose. Amelia stayed behind, but was later called in because Betty was among those brought in and had collapsed with chest pain. John and Carol waited in the waiting room with Owen and Amelia for news on Betty while she had heart surgery. When they were told Betty would be okay, they were excited. However, Carol wasn't sure how they'd tell Betty that Linus, her boyfriend, had died while she was in surgery. John didn't want to, but Amelia said she needed to know and hoped it would be Betty's bottom as Ryan had been for her. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\nTwo weeks later, when Betty had mostly healed from her surgery, they packed up Leo's things and left to take both of them home. However, later that night, they brought Leo back, as Betty had decided she wanted to get to be a kid and she couldn't do that if she had to be Leo's mom. She decided to give Leo to Owen and Amelia. ''(\"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Carol Dickinson]].\n\n===Familial===\nJohn's daughter, Britney (aka Betty), ran away from home after becoming addicted to drugs following a soccer injury. She had a baby by her drug dealer and he was placed in foster care after he was born. After running away from rehab and nearly dying when drugs she'd taken damaged her heart, they went to take her and Leo back home with them, but Britney decided she wanted Leo to stay with Owen and Amelia because she wanted to be able to be a kid.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*The last thing he said to his daughter before she ran away was, \"I can't even stand to look at you.\"<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], 15x14</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n15x13JohnDickinson.png|[[I Walk the Line]]\n15x14JohnDickinson.png|[[I Want a New Drug]]\n15x15JohnDickinson.png|[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x14-4.jpg\n15x14-5.jpg\n15x14-9.jpg\n15x14-10.jpg\n15x14-11.jpg\n15x14-12.jpg\n15x14-13.jpg\n15x14-14.jpg\n15x14-15.jpg\n15x14-16.jpg\n15x14-17.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{John Dickinson Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dickinson, John}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
