She had a second mass removed from her lung, but her tests revealed the cancer had spread. Two months later, she was re-admitted to the hospital with pulmonary edema and made the decision to end her life through physician-assisted suicide. Teddy asked [[Owen Hunt]] to consult on the case to be the second physician signature, but when he refused, [[Mark Sloan]] became the second.\n\nHowever, Owen's doubts forced Teddy and [[Cristina Yang]] to run more tests, which confirmed that nothing more could be done. Owen then confronted Kim, asking what would happen if they found a cure tomorrow. She said that even if it did, it was too late for her.\n\nHer husband filled the prescription and then lay beside her while she died.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to [[Sean Allen]] until her death.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Allen, Kim}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}}}]}}}}
