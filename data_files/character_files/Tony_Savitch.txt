He was nervous about the surgery and not eager about the lifestyle changes he needed to make afterward. George comforted him and his wife by saying it was a very routine procedure and that Tony would be fine. He then promised them he'd be okay.\n\nWhile drawing pre-op labs, George had to stick Tony multiple times before Burke ultimately took over and drew the blood himself.\n\nBurke took him into surgery, where there were complications that resulted in his death. When Burke heard what George had said, he made George tell the family about Tony's death.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to [[Gloria Savitch]] until his death and they had four daughters.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*His room was decorated with children's drawings, presumably drawn by his daughters.\n*He has the distinction of being the first person to die on ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.\n\n[[de:Tony Savitch]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Savitch, Tony}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
