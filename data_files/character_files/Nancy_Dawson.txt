When Rachel, who had woken up, joked with the still unconscious Paul, Nancy started to cry, as she wasn't ready for her son to die before her. ''(\"[[Sleeping Monster]]\")''\n\nAfter Paul had been unconscious for eight days, they began to worry that he'd never wake up. While she was napping at her hotel, Ethan took an overdose of her sleeping pills and had to be rushed back to the ER. Social services came to talk to them, but noting the unusual circumstances, they didn't take Ethan into custody. Nancy began to question if they should, however, as she is older and not fit to raise an active 10 year old. ''(\"[[Do You Believe in Magic]]\")''\n\nAfter nine days, Nancy talked to [[Cristina Yang]] about withdrawing care. Cristina advised her that as there had been no improvement for eight days, the neurological deficits would most likely be permanent. When a clot was discovered, she consented to a surgery that could possibly kill him. The procedure worked and Paul woke up. ''(\"[[Readiness is All]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married. Her husband is in a facility and she takes the bus to see him.\n\n===Familial===\nShe has a son, [[Paul Dawson]]. When Paul; his wife, [[Rachel Dawson|Rachel]]; and their son, [[Ethan Dawson|Ethan]] were in a car accident, Nancy flew to [[Seattle]] to see them and take care of Ethan while his parents were both hospitalized. After Rachel died and it appeared that Paul might not wake up, Nancy admitted that she wasn't fit to raise Ethan on her own. However, Paul eventually did wake up.
