When a tunnel collapsed, they rushed to help her while she tended to [[Joan Paulson]]. He also at one point took blood samples to the lab while eating food from the rescheduled reception of [[Richard Webber]] and [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]]. ''(\"[[Time Stops]]\")''\n\nWhen the doctors realized that they had a very short window to get [[Keith Gardner]] to an OR after removing him from his car, Isaac, along with the other interns, was posted along the path to keep it clear for them. He rounded out his first day by rounding on a stable, post-op Joan and getting the opportunity to ask Stephanie questions. ''(\"[[You're My Home]]\")''\n\n===[[Aliyah Hamed]]===\nWhile the doctors were operating on Aliyah, Amelia pointed out that Meredith was mad about the wall. Isaac asked what wall, but he was quickly silenced and told just to stand there. ''(\"[[Sledgehammer]]\")''\n\n===Anatomy Class===\nIsaac attended Meredith's anatomy class. ''(\"[[Sledgehammer]]\")''\n\n===[[Jade Bell]]===\nWhen Jade Bell came into the ER with a head laceration, Isaac wanted to discharge her after stitching it up. However, she was later admitted to the hospital with a pituitary tumor. ''(\"[[Walking Tall]]\")''\n\n===Communication Training===\nSeeing that the interns weren't well-trained in delivering bad news to patient families, [[Owen Hunt]] insisted that they all be trained. He taught them the four Ls (Location, language, body language, and leave) and informed them that they'd be telling the families of the people who died in the ER that day. ''(\"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\")''\n\n===Dinner Party===\nNot wanting to go out to get it herself, [[Jo Wilson]] called Issac from the party to get him to go to the store and buy cheese for the party. He showed up with the cheese and Jo tried to dismiss him, but Arizona invited him to sit with them, so he pulled up a toy rocking horse and joined them at the table. ''(\"[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\")''\n\n===[[Maya Roberts]]===\nWhile working on the case of Maya Roberts, Isaac, along with Alex, was fired by Maya. He wondered how that worked and if it would go on his permanent record. ''(\"[[All I Want is You]]\")''\n\n===Triple Organ Transplant===\nIsaac worked on the procurement side of [[Kelsey|Kelsey's]] transplant surgery. ''(\"[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]]\")''\n\n===Code Pink===\nDuring the Code Pink, Isaac found himself unable to get through a door as he expected. He later went through the door when Alex opened it with a security guard's badge. ''(\"[[There's a Fine, Fine Line]]\")''\n\n===Andrew's Beating===\nWhen Andrew was badly beaten by Alex, Isaac met the ambulance and treated Andrew in the ER. ''(\"[[Undo]]\")''\n\n===Kidney Transplant===\nIsaac scrubbed in to assist Ben on a kidney retrieval. When the kidney was removed, the remaining kidney died and Ben and Isaac kept her stable while they tried to figure out if the kidney would be given back to her or transplanted as intended. While they worked, they talked about what they'd do. Ben believed Cynthia would want the kidney to go to her son, but Isaac said with only one kidney, she might want to keep it, as that's what he'd want to do. ''(\"[[Back Where You Belong]]\")''\n\n===Tuberculosis===\nIsaac lay in a bed in the ER when he had abdominal pain. Stephanie didn't take his concern seriously and believed he had nothing. However, he insisted she treat him, so she did a CT, which showed diverticulitis. April, Stephanie, and Andrew took him into surgery, where April discovered abdominal tuberculosis. The OR was quarantined and after April finished his surgery, Isaac was put in isolation to recover. ''(\"[[What's Inside]]\")''\n\n===Hospital Fire===\nDuring the fire that covered two floors of the hospital, Isaac and Ben carried one patient at a time down the four flights of stairs to evacuate them. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Jo Wilson]]====\nIsaac developed a crush on Jo and began flirting with her, offering to wait with her for lab samples and becoming excited when she tried to stop [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] from taking him to prep a patient for surgery. However, she was completely oblivious to his advances. ''(\"[[Walking Tall]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nIsaac is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He joined the program for the 2016-2017 [[Resident|residency]] year, and was assigned to [[Stephanie Edwards]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He once saw LeBron James at an airport.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], 12x02</ref>\n*He's allergic to iodine dye.<ref>[[What's Inside]], 13x19</ref>\n*He has insurance through the Affordable Care Act.<ref>[[What's Inside]], 13x19</ref>\n*His grandmother smoked.<ref>[[What's Inside]], 13x19</ref>\n*He went on a cruise to Baja with his mom.<ref>[[What's Inside]], 13x19</ref>\n*He spent a month in India volunteering.<ref>[[What's Inside]], 13x19</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x23Isaac.png|[[Time Stops]]\n11x24Isaac.png|[[You're My Home]]\n12x01IsaacCross.png|[[Sledgehammer]]\n12x02IsaacCross.png|[[Walking Tall]]\n12x04IsaacCross.png|[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\n12x05IsaacCross.png|[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]\n12x06IsaacCross.png|[[The Me Nobody Knows]]\n12x07IsaacCross.png|[[Something Against You]]\n12x08IsaacCross.png|[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\n12x09IsaacCross.png|[[The Sound of Silence]]\n12x10IsaacCross.png|[[All I Want is You]]\n12x15IsaacCross.png|[[I Am Not Waiting Anymore]]\n12x18IsaacCross.png|[[There's a Fine, Fine Line]]\n12x24IsaacCross.png|[[Family Affair]]\n13x01IsaacCross.png|[[Undo]]\n13x14IsaacCross.png|[[Back Where You Belong]]\n13x19IsaacCross.png|[[What's Inside]]\n13x24IsaacCross.png|[[Ring of Fire]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n12x01-5.jpg\n12x01-8.jpg\n12x01-9.jpg\n12x04-11.jpg\n12x04-28.jpg\n12x04-35.jpg\n12x05-1.jpg\n12x05-8.jpg\n12x05-10.jpg\n12x05-21.jpg\n12x06-16.jpg\n12x06-33.jpg\n12x06-54.jpg\n12x06-57.jpg\n12x15-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Isaac Cross Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Isaac Cross]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cross, Isaac}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ID)]]"}}}]}}}}
