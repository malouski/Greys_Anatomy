During the delivery, he lost about half his blood volume. After his birth, he was rushed to the NICU, where he struggled to breathe. He was put on ECMO as a last-ditch effort to save his life. It was unsuccessful and he died in the NICU.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nCosmo's family was in a car accident when his mom was pregnant with him. He and his mother both died as a result of the accident.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Cosmo was not his name, just what his parents called him while they were expecting him, because he was conceived under the influence of cosmopolitans.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Singh, \"Cosmo\"}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neonatal)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
