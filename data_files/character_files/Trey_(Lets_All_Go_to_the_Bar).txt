He suggested the back door for evacuation, though that turned out to be blocked. He later held a stool for Pruitt to stand on to retrieve supplies through a window. When Taryn's leg needed to be set, he served her two shots of whiskey so she could tolerate the pain. After the firefighters cleared an exit and the injured were taken out of the bar, Trey sat at the bar and drank a drink of his own.
