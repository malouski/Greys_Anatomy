Billie opened the radiator cap and got burned on their arm. Frankie called for help and Travis and Vic quickly arrived. Vic treated Billie's burn and then they left the kids waiting for a tow. After they left, Kayden, believing he could fix the car, poured gasoline in the radiator, causing an explosion and fire. Conor and Frankie immediately ran away but Billie stayed with Kayden until Travis and Vic came back. They intubated Kayden at the scene and then took him to Grey Sloan, even though Grey Sloan was supposed to be taking only Covid cases. ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")''\n\nIn the ER, they started treating his burns. They put in an IO line to start an IV and had to perform an escharotomy to allow his lungs to expand when the burns restricted his chest movement. Once that was done, he was taken to the OR for debridement. After his surgery, he was stable in the ICU and being treated with burn cream. His mother came to visit him, even though it was against the hospital rules. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nAfter surgery, Kayden was taken to the ICU, where Jackson continued to treat his burns until he realized his chest burns went all the way down to his lungs. He was rushed back into surgery, but they were unable to save him and he died in the OR. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was dating someone. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\n===Familial===\nHis parents, especially his mother, were extremely concerned about him when he was in the hospital. His mother said he was still her baby and still said I love you to her every time he left the house and wouldn't shut the door until she said it back. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\n===Friendships===\nHe is friends with Conor, Frankie, and Billie. They were graduating seniors and upset with graduation and prom being cancelled, so they decided to have a party despite the quarantine in effect.
