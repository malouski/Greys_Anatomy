When a liver became available, they were eager for her to get her transplant. After her surgery, they wanted to see her, but were told she needed to be monitored for a while because they weren't able to close. However, she later had a second surgery to place a ping pong ball and they were able to close and Martin and Leanne were able to see her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Leanne Collis]].\n\n===Familial===\nHis daughter, Lisa, was born with biliary atresia.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n7x08-1.jpg\n7x08-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Collis, Martin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
