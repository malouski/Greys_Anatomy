''(\"[[Freedom, Part 1]]\")''\n\nAndrew asked for Lola, so Callie went to get her. She refused to come because she was worried about what [[Kip]], [[David (Freedom)|David]], and [[Will (Freedom)|Will]] would think. Callie told her that this matters and they don't. And she told Lola that if Andrew died, she would hate herself and she'd be right. Lola later reconsidered and sat by Andrew's bedside after his surgery. ''(\"[[Freedom, Part 2]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe liked [[Andrew Langston]], but didn't act on the feelings because she was worried about what her friends would think.
