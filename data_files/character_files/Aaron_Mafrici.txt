These moments allow him to express his real feelings, because spends all day making himself smaller, knowing he's too big, physically and emotionally, thereby tending to hide his real emotions. At some point in his life, Aaron met [[Jeffrey]] and they developed a romantic relationship.\n\n===Hospitalization===\nUpon noticing he lost his complete upper register, he and Jeffrey came to the\u00a0[[Emergency Room|ER]]\u00a0to find out what was wrong. As the ER was busy and no one paid immediate attention to him, he started singing loudly to make the doctors hear him and to make them understand the seriousness of the problem.\n\nAfter some initial exams, Drs. Altman, Yang, and Karev found a malignancy on his left lung, which turned out to be pleural mesothelioma, a cancer surrounding the lining of his lung. Upon hearing that in the worst case scenario, his lung would have to be removed, Aaron stated that he rather die than lose his lung, and thus the ability to continue singing.\n\n===Surgery===\nDuring surgery, Teddy found that removing the lung would provide the biggest chance of survival, but because of his statement, she decided to remove the visible tumor and treat him with intrapleural hyperthermic therapy.\n\nAlex informed Jeffrey post-op that Aaron should be fine.\n\n==Personality==\nAaron stated his feelings are often too big to fit the situation properly, e.g. wanting to kill the waiter when his steak isn't cooked as he asked for. Aaron also tends to look down on others.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nAaron has a relationship with [[Jeffrey]]. Jeffrey stated he does basically everything to take care of Aaron, and still Aaron thinks little of him.\n\n==Career==\nAaron is a singer, and has been described as an incredibly good one. His work is what allows him to express his real feelings, which is why he'd rather die if he couldn't continue singing.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Aaron always needs to have clean humidifiers and he counts on Jeffrey to clean them for him.\n*Using his job to express his real feelings is a little reminiscent of Callie using ortho to relieve her anger.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mafrici, Aaron}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
