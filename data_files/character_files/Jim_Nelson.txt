''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n===John Doe===\nWhen [[George O'Malley|John Doe's]] post-op CT showed a re-bleed, Derek said he'd have Nelson take care of it so he and Meredith could go get married. However, Derek ended up doing the surgery himself. ''(\"[[Now or Never]]\")''\n\n===Hospital Merger===\nJim was involved in a meeting with the attendings regarding the merger. Cristina later tried to flirt her way onto one of his surgeries, but he knew that she was into cardio. ''(\"[[Tainted Obligation]]\")''\n\n===Brain Tumor===\nNelson had a patient with a brain tumor that [[Meredith Grey]] diagnosed. He was going to let her debulk the tumor, but Derek took the case for himself. ''(\"[[Suicide is Painless]]\")''\n\n===Derek's Hand===\nWhen Derek's hand went numb in surgery after his plane crash injuries, Nelson stepped in to take over. ''(\"[[Going, Going, Gone]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nHe is not well-known amongst his colleagues. Mark didn't remember him even though they'd been introduced three times before. At the end of the day, Jim invited Mark to get a drink, but Mark declined. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nDr. Nelson was the interim [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Neurosurgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] before Derek was hired.\n\nAccording to [[Callie Torres|Callie]], he is a good surgeon, publishes a lot of research, but because he isn't [[Derek Shepherd|Shepherd]] and [[Richard Webber|Richard's]] golden boy, he falls to the sidelines frequently, so much so that Richard does not actually consider him for any of Derek's surgeries when Derek \"leaves\". [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] has also failed to notice him in the time he's been working at Seattle Grace, despite Jim working there for more than 10 years. Amelia once called his work sloppy.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*In his first appearance, he was credited as Dr. John Nelson.\n*Although his last appearance was in season six, he has been mentioned a couple of times in later seasons, indicating he's still part of the staff of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.\n*It's possible Jim got to step up as the hospital's best neurosurgeon when Derek started consulting on the Brain Mapping Project. However, that was only briefly as\u00a0[[Amelia Shepherd]], who's nearly as good as her brother, joined the hospital staff before Derek joined the Project full-time.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Appearances===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n517JimNelson.png|[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\n6x04JimNelson.png|[[Tainted Obligation]]\n6x18JimNelson.png|[[Suicide is Painless]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Jim Nelson Appearances}}\n[[de:Jim Nelson]]\n[[fr:Jim Nelson]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nelson, Jim}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
