However, the keys got stuck in his esophagus. He continued to argue with Athena as Izzie stuck a bronchoscope down his throat to get the keys. When she finally reached them, the keys fell down a few more inches, making it hard for him to breathe. The keys were then quickly retrieved and Izzie handed them over to Athena, advising her to leave.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nJP was seeing [[Athena]]. Their relationship ended when he called her therapist pretending to be his therapist, trying to find out what she'd been saying about him. He swallowed her keys to keep her from leaving, but they got caught in his throat. Once her keys were retrieved, she left him.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
