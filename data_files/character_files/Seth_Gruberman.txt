After his bar mitzvah, his parents said that he could make the decision to have surgery to have the excess breast tissue removed. However, when the time came, his mother was still reluctant, saying they couldn't just cut off the parts of their body they didn't like. Seth was being bullied at school and wanted to have the surgery before high school, when it would be all new kids.\n\nDespite this, his mother wanted to take him home. As she was preparing the discharge papers, Alex came in and talked Mindy into letting Seth have the surgery. Seth had his surgery and woke up, delighted to see that he no longer had breasts.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis father also had gynecomastia. His mother was still reluctant to let him have surgery, though she ultimately relented.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 13 at the time of his surgery.\n*Before his surgery, one kid kept putting a bra in his locker.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gruberman, Seth}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
