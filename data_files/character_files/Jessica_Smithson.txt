By the time she was six, she was nearing the end of her life. Jessica had a seizure and was having trouble breathing. They rose up her bed and got her breathing stabilized. [[Arizona Robbins]] talked to her father, Matt, and said that this was the end of the road. He insisted that they just needed a little more time so that he could get her to Mexico for an experimental treatment. He left the hospital to try to put the money together to get her to Mexico. When Jessica woke up, she asked where her dad was, saying she wanted him. Bailey saw that she was scared and so she rocked Jessica with her like she rocked her own son when he was scared. When Jessica fell asleep, Bailey put her back in her hospital bed and lay next to her. Her father came in and told her they were going to Mexico. She asked if they could go tomorrow because she was tired. Bailey tried to get him to trade places with her, but he was still trying to get the money together to go to Mexico.\n\nHe came back to the hospital and Bailey got him to understand that he needed to stop and hold his daughter while she died.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer father didn't want to face the reality that she was dying and frantically tried to extend her life by getting her to Mexico for an experimental treatment. Bailey and Arizona finally got him to understand that she was dying and he held her while she died.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 6 at the time of her death.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n5x20-23.jpg\n5x20-28.jpg\n5x20-29.jpg\n5x20-30.jpg\n5x20-32.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smithson, Jessica}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
