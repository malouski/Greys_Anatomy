She managed it well until she visited Thailand, where she got really sick and was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure. She was at the hospital after losing the access port she had for dialysis. Due a clotting disorder, they had trouble getting access and were attempting her last possible site. She was a social media influencer and filmed much of her examination. While speaking to [[Winston Ndugu|Winston]], she told him she wasn't on the list for a kidney transplant because she'd been told she wasn't eligible. Winston looked into this and found out that because Rashida is Black, there was a multiplier applied to her eGFR, which made it seem like her kidneys were functioning better than they were. Without the multiplier, she would have qualified. Winston went to Rashida's nephrologist, [[Alicia Krause]], and asked her about it and she said she'd review the case. When they had to pull Rashida's port shortly after it was place due to superior vena cava syndrome, Winston went back to Krause an insisted she be placed on the transplant list. When Rashida woke up, he was able to tell her she'd been put on the list. She then went live with her doctors to tell her followers the news. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nSoon afterward, a kidney became available for Rashida. She excitedly told her followers and prepared for the surgery. However, the overworked hospital HVAC system went out, which meant all surgeries were cancelled and the kidney needed to be redirected to the next patient on the list. Instead of allowing that to happen, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] and Winston called [[Ben Warren|Ben]] and had him bring the PRT to the hospital so they could use the OR inside for Rashida's surgery. It went well and Rashida's new kidney immediately started working. Rashida woke up excited to be able to start traveling again. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother and brother both died of kidney failure secondary to diabetes.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a social media influencer. She previously blogged about her travels, but after her health declined, she shifted to streaming and posting about her medical treatment.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n18x02RashidaFlowers.png|[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\n18x03RashidaFlowers.png|[[Hotter Than Hell]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n18x02-14.jpg\n18x02-17.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her case is another example of racial inequity in medicine as the standard test used to confirm transplant-eligibility unfairly disqualified her from the procedure given the racial bias in the testing.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], 18x02</ref>\n**This is the kind of case that [[Jackson Avery|Dr. Avery]] as the new head of the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]] is looking to correct in its mission to have equity in medicine.<ref>[[Look Up Child]], 17x14</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Rashida Flowers Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flowers, Rashida}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
