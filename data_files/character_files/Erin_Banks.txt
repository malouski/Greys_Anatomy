Andrew was immediately suspicious of the fact that Opal did all the talking while Cindy just stood there. He shared his concerns with [[Nurse Liv]] and asked her to get Bailey for him. Meanwhile, he ran additional tests to keep Opal and Cindy in the clinic. Bailey came down to the clinic, but doubted Andrew's claims. She went to check on Cindy herself and didn't detect anything unusual in their reactions, so she told Andrew to treat Cindy and let it go. Despite this, he persisted. He promised Cindy a spot in Meredith's pro bono surgery day for her hernia and used that as an excuse to get Cindy away. He then questioned her, but she revealed nothing and Opal quickly discovered them. A crowd gathered and they tried to talk Andrew down, even as he continued to call for security to arrest Opal. They eventually got Andrew to leave the area and Opal and Cindy embraced. However, later, Opal dragged Cindy out of the hospital by her arm, saying she must have said something to the doctor to tip him off, though Cindy swore she didn't. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\nErin later came back to the hospital. She said that she had gotten sicker and so Opal dropped her off on the side of the interstate, proclaiming her useless. At the hospital, she was examined again and told the doctors her real name and that she was from Scottsdale, Arizona. She'd been \"discovered\" on Snapchat. The photographer wanted to meet her, but her parents and sister all said it was sketchy. She decided to sneak out and go anyway and ended up spending two years being trafficked. Opal threatened to kill her if she ran away and said she'd take her sister if she told anyone. She had surgery to repair her hernia and was given IV antibiotics post-op. When she was found, her sister, Abby, was going to school in Portland and came to Seattle, where they were happily reunited.
