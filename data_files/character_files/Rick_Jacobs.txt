He was found unconscious, but he was conscious in the ER and was talking. They thought the adrenaline was keeping him from feeling the extent of his injuries, so they took him for a CT. However, the CT revealed only an appendiceal hematoma, meaning he only needed an appendectomy.\n\nThe interns watched the video from his helmet and heard him say that he was in love with his skydiving instructor, [[Sally]].\n\nAfter his surgery, he said he was disappointed because he'd only have a small scar. [[Meredith Grey]] then warned him that the feeling that he could do anything would go away, so he should tell Sally how he feels while he still has it. He was worried Sally wouldn't feel the same way. Meredith said if she doesn't, he can move on, but he'll regret it if he doesn't try.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was in love with [[Sally]] and she didn't know. He thought she was way out of his league, so he never said anything.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 33 at the time of his accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jacobs, Rick}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
