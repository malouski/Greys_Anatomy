However, after they slept together, her parents fought and her father returned to the United States. ''(\"[[One Day Like This]]\")'' When Teddy found out she was pregnant, she came to the United States to tell Owen. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n===Birth===\nTeddy went to Owen's place to profess her love for him, but found [[Amelia Shepherd]] and Leo there alone instead. While she was there, her water broke. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")'' Shortly afterward, her labor started. Amelia timed her contractions and then started to drive Teddy to the hospital in her car. When they were stopped because the freeway was closed due to a crash, Amelia found a police officer to take them to the hospital. At the hospital, Teddy was joined by Owen as she labored and gave birth. When the baby was born, both Teddy and Owen decided to name her Allison. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n===Teddy's PTSD===\nWhen Teddy struggled in the aftermath of Andrew's death, Owen brought her home, along with Allison. Allison struggled with this, asking for her mom and not understanding why Teddy wasn't coming. At the end of the day, when Allison cried, Teddy got out of bed and held her. ''(\"[[In My Life]]\")''\n\n===Play Date===\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, Leo, Allison, and Scout all had a play date together with Teddy and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, Owen came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n===Christmas===\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Teddy and Owen's Wedding===\nAllison came to the park with Teddy and Owen on the day they were meant to get married. The wedding was interrupted by a bicycle accident, but they later got married at [[Emerald City Bar]].
