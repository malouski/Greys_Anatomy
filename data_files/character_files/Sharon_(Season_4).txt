She was upset with Joyce for not preventing the kidnapping, but quickly ended up insisting they get in the house along with Joyce. When the cops arrived, they tried to remove the women, saying the homeowner had complained about them creating a disturbance. When a window broke, leading them to a fire that was burning in the basement, Dean and Sullivan went inside after them. They were able to follow the sounds of their voices to a locked room where they found the two girls and pulled them out. Once they were outside, the girls started to breathe again. Sharon got into the ambulance with Shanice, who was given oxygen. Shanice apologized, explaining what had happened and confessing that they started the fire in order to lure help. [[Officer Schneider]] heard her say this and noted it on his notebook, then went to question Jada about the fire while Sharon and Shanice were taken to the hospital. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\nIn the ER, Shanice was treated for smoke inhalation and then moved to a room while waiting for a chest x-ray. Sharon was told she could take Shanice home if it was clear. Sharon was upset because even though there was a pandemic and her daughter had been kidnapped, she had to get up the next day and go back to work.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe was upset when her daughter was kidnapped after staying the night at a friend's house. When the girls were found safe, Sharon reassured her daughter that it wasn't her fault.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nS194x05Sharon.png|[[Out of Control]]\n17x06Sharon.png|[[No Time for Despair]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Sharon Appearances}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Sharon}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
