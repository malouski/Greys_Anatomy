The roller coaster derailed and the car they were in crashed into the ground. Since Greg had serious crush injuries, the whole car was transported to the hospital so they could be carefully extracted from the car. In the ER, firefighters removed Greg's harness, which left him struggling to breathe. His neck had been fractured, so he was put in traction to stabilize his neck then removed. Once he was out of the car, they noticed that Cleo had a puncture wound to her side that was bleeding heavily. They transfused blood and rushed her into surgery, where her abdomen was repaired.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nShe is friends with fellow residents, [[Gregory Williams]] and [[Liza Simmons]]. When Greg said they had to do more than just work all the same, they went to a carnival together, which ended poorly when the roller coaster derailed.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a second-year [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 26 at the time of her hospitalization.\n*She specifically requested that Meredith operate on her.\n*She does not believe in Hell.\n*She's a big fan of the Harper Avery Award, and knew of Meredith, Jackson, and Catherine because of it.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x07-40.jpg\n14x07-41.jpg\n14x07-42.jpg\n14x07-43.jpg\n14x07-44.jpg\n14x07-45.jpg\n14x07-46.jpg\n14x07-47.jpg\n14x07-49.jpg\n14x07-50.jpg\n14x07-52.jpg\n14x07-55.jpg\n14x07-56.jpg\n14x07-57.jpg\n14x07-58.jpg\n14x07-60.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kim, Cleo}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
