Dr. Siegel argued with them, especially after learning that they weren't attendings. Ben, to Siegel's horror, broke off a piece of his clipboard and used it to open the patient's chest. Siegel later left an outraged message for [[Miranda Bailey]] which led to Ben being suspended.\n\n==Career==\nHe is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Siegel, Dr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
