Before the presentation, he went to [[Emerald City Bar]], where he met Meredith, but was unaware of who she was. After he learned who she was, he told her she'd wasted a year of his life, which he had spent researching abdominal wall transplants. After she did hers, he told his team that the procedure worked, but he unfortunately wouldn't do the first.\n\nHe later attended Meredith's talk and applauded when she announced that the Grey Method would be now know as the Grey-Cerone Method, to honor Marie Cerone's contribution.\n\n==Career==\nHe's a general surgeon. He was working on a way to transplant an abdominal wall when Meredith operated on [[Megan Hunt]], making his research moot.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He likes the gloom of Seattle because he grew up in Los Angeles and has had enough sunshine.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x22-16.jpg\n14x22-17.jpg\n14x22-18.jpg\n14x22-19.jpg\n14x22-21.jpg\n14x22-22.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:David}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
