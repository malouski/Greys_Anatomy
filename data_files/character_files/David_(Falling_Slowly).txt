He told Alex that he'd had it for a few weeks, but it started to smell, which is why he came in. Alex looks at the abscess and said it needed to be lanced and drained. He was going to do it, but Timir reminded him he couldn't and told him to page surgery. Jo later responded to the page and treated him.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:David}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]"}}}]}}}}
