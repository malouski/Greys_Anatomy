In order to treat it, he was having a corpus callosotomy. His wife opposed the surgery, but Taylor said he wanted it because they had a young son and he was never left alone with the baby for fear he'd have a seizure.\n\nWhile his wife, Lianne, was discussing aftercare with [[Cristina Yang]], Taylor was holding their son. Taylor then started seizing and Cristina had to catch the baby before he hit the ground. After that seizure, Lianne agreed that the surgery was the only option.\n\nAfter his surgery, he had trouble coming up with the words for things and couldn't remember his wife and son's names. This disturbed Lianne. Lianne was then informed he'd need to create new pathways between the two sides of his brain and that would take time.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Lianne Tressel]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe has one son, named Jake after Taylor's father.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He's a good tester. He did well on his SATs.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n3x03-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tressel, Taylor}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
