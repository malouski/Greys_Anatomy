He enjoys hunting and has an interest in cars.\n\n==History==\n===Thanksgiving===\nEvery year, Harold took his three sons out hunting to shoot a turkey. When he was an intern, Harold insisted that it would be George's year to shoot the turkey. While they were out in the woods, the others started trading cars, but George didn't participate. They believed it was because he didn't know anything about cars, but he explained that it was always the same conversation over and over again and he was tired of it. George ultimately did shoot the turkey, but as they were packing up, one of them accidentally shot Harold in the butt. George took him to the hospital where he removed the birdshot and stitched him up. ''(\"[[Thanks for the Memories]]\")''\n\n===Father's Cancer===\nJerry and Ronny both came to the hospital after Harold fell and broke his clavicle. They were both there when he received the news that Harold had cancer and also needed a valve replacement. Callie used car metaphors to help them both understand how series his medical issues were. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\n===Dad's Death===\nWhen Harold's organs started shutting down, his family was informed that he would not be able to wake up and they were given the choice to let nature take its course or turn off life support. They chose to turn off life support and stayed with him while he died. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part 2]]\")''\n\n===George's Death===\nJerry and Ronny were out on a fishing expedition in Alaska when George died. Their mother told them about his death when they came home. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n==Personality==\nJerry is an enthusiastic guy who enjoys talking about old cars and hunting, but isn't exactly all for George's interests, such as medicine, medical terms, and George's friends. Jerry also has a very goofy side to him, often making many jokes.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe has a strong bond with his brother, [[Ronny O'Malley|Ronny]], and his parents. His bond with George isn't as strong.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a dry cleaner.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He gets gassy when he's nervous.<ref>[[Six Days, Part 2]], 3x12</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n209JerryO'Malley.png|[[Thanks for the Memories]]\n308JerryO'Malley.png|[[Staring at the Sun]]\n310JerryO'Malley.png|[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\n311JerryO'Malley.png|[[Six Days, Part 1]]\n312JerryO'Malley.png|[[Six Days, Part 2]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x09-1.JPG\n2x09-2.JPG\n2x09-3.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Jerry O'Malley Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[es:Jerry O'Malley]]\n[[fr:Jerry O'Malley]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:O'Malley, Jerry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
