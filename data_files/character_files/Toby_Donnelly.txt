They were both airlifted to the hospital. Toby had a deep soft tissue injury to their shoulder with arterial compromise. Richard did an ultrasound and ordered a CT angio to check for other internal injuries. The CT showed that there was no blood flow to their arm, so they were taken into surgery. The surgery went well and they were stable and away afterward, but Toby was then told their mother would be paralyzed from the neck down due to her own injuries. ''(\"[[Add It Up]]\")''\n\nToby was hopeful when the doctors came to them about a new treatment for Kari, involving stem cells directly injected into her spine. Toby said they were especially aware of their arms and legs because Kari couldn't use hers and they wanted their mother to regain used of her arms if she could. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nThirteen days after her transfusion, Kari still had no movement in her arms and had pneumonia. A CT revealed a lesion on her lung, so they had to remove a portion of her lung. Despite these setbacks, she said she didn't regret it because she was finally living her life in a way that made her happy, which had been inspired by Toby coming out to her. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nShortly after her surgery, Kari's finger twitched. They thought it might just be a spasm, but monitored her just in case. Just when she was about to give up on it, she squeezed Toby's hand. They celebrated and she had even more purposeful movement of her hand and fingers, showing that the stem cells had been a success. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nToby says their mom is the one with all the answers and when Toby learned their mom would be paralyzed, they didn't know what to do. ''(\"[[Add It Up]]\")''\n\nTheir mother describes their father as a jerk. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*They were 22 at the time of their hospitalization.\n*They are gender-queer and their pronouns are \"they\" and \"them.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x18TobyDonnelly.png|[[Add It Up]]\n15x22TobyDonnelly.png|[[Head Over High Heels]]\n15x24TobyDonnelly.png|[[Drawn to the Blood]]\n15x25TobyDonnelly.png|[[Jump Into the Fog]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x18-9.jpg\n15x18-10.jpg\n15x18-11.jpg\n15x18-12.jpg\n15x18-13.jpg\n15x18-14.jpg\n15x18-18.jpg\n15x18-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Toby Donnelly Appearances}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Donnelly, Toby}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
