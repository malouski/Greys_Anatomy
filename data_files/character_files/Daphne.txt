While she was in the hospital, she continuously studied because she was close to graduating with honors. She was set to be discharged, but Meredith noticed that the area around her chemo port was red, indicating infection. She examined the area and found signs of infection, so she removed the port. However, the area then started bleeding severely. Meredith applied pressure to the area and gave her clotting factors. [[Nathan Riggs]] was called in because of the location of the port. He wanted to take her to surgery, but Meredith said they were going to hold pressure and wait to see if she'd clot on her own.\n\nThey ran labs, which showed septicemia. Because of this, they started to prepare for a possible move to the OR. Meredith told Daphne that if she moved her hand and it started bleeding, they'd have to rush her into surgery. They then told Daphne that she needed to call [[David]], despite her insistence that she didn't want to call him until she had done something she could be proud of. She called David and he agreed to come to the hospital to see her. When Meredith removed her hand, Daphne started bleeding, so Meredith re-applied pressure and they rushed Daphne to an OR, leaving a trail of blood behind them. However, despite their best efforts, they were unable to save her. When David arrived at the hospital, he was taken to see her body.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nDaphne put other things ahead of her son, David, and that led to her leaving him when he was fourteen. She later contacted him on the day of her death and he agreed to come see her.\n\n==Career==\nShe worked two jobs in addition to going to school.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n12x12-14.jpg\n12x12-25.jpg\n12x12-26.jpg\n12x12-27.jpg\n12x12-32.jpg\n12x12-33.jpg\n12x12-34.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
