She'd previously tripped on the sidewalk and cracked a rib, fallen in a shower and broken her arm, and broken two fingers doing yoga. George suggested they run more tests to find the cause.\n\nThey found a parathyroid tumor, which they determined to be benign and easy to remove. They scheduled surgery to remove the tumor. Afterward, she declared that she was going to Denver to be with the guy she'd had to break up with due to the tumor.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was in love with a guy, but he had to move to Denver and she couldn't move with him because of her constant broken bones. After she had her tumor removed, she decided to go to Denver to be with him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*The hip was her\u00a0sixth break in a year.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Margaret}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]"}}}]}}}}
