When [[Winston Ndugu]], who was placing an access port so Rashida could receive dialysis, learned she wasn't on the transplant list, he went to Krause to ask about it and was told Rashida wasn't eligible as her eGFR was too high. After placing the port, Winston went back to Krause, explaining that he'd found patients with similar numbers to Rashida who were on the list because they were white and not subjected to a multiplier applied to all Black patients due to assumptions made about Black people. Krause said she would look into it. When Rashinda's port had to be removed shortly after insertion, Winston told Krause he wouldn't reinsert it and demanded that Rashida be placed on the transplant list. He was successful and she was placed on the list.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a [[Board Certification|board-certified]] attending [[Nephrology|nephrologist]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. During the pandemic, many of her patients put off seeing her, so when it ended, she was very busy seeing those patients.\n\nAs evidenced by the embroidery on her lab coat, she is a Fellow of the American Society of Nephrology.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Krause, Alicia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
