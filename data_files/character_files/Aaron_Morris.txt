Two months later, when Covid-19 hit, Aaron told his son that staying home was how they would say thanks to the doctors who had saved his life. When he learned that Frankie had been injured in a fire while out with friends, he rushed down to the hospital to wait for him. While he was there, he talked to [[Deborah Lee|Deborah]] and [[Steve Lee]], whose son was also injured in the fire. He and Steve got into a fight when Steve blamed Frankie for the kids being out in the first place, because he was constantly posting about missing his friends. Aaron then said it was Kayden's fault because he was following the example his parents set by still having get-togethers. This made the fight turn physical, with Steve shoving Aaron down. Aaron then got up and shoved Steve in turn, injuring them both.

Aaron was later told that they had to remove a portion of his kidney, but he was going to make it.\n\nWhen he saw Steve Lee grieving his son's death on the other side of the ER, Aaron went over and comforted him as he cried.

Shortly after his transplant, the Covid-19 pandemic reached the US and things started shutting down.
