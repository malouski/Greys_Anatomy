Later, his body started to reject that liver, so he was in the hospital waiting for another liver to become available for transplant. [[Alex Karev]] took the case to [[Meredith Grey]] to look for more treatment options. She examined Danny and decided that she wanted to rebuild his biliary tree, which would prevent further infections and give him more time to wait for a transplant and would even allow him to go home while he waited. Danny wanted the surgery, but Kathy was scared of the risks.\n\nWhen Danny's conditioned worsened, he again insisted that he wanted the surgery. Kathy admitted that he was almost an adult and had very little control over his own life, so she agreed to do what he wanted and Danny had the surgery. In surgery, he had a lot of bleeding, so Meredith put in a shunt, but the anastomosis leaked. They tried to repair the damage, but despite their best efforts, Danny died in the OR. When they told Kathy, she was devastated to hear of his death.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nFollowing the death of their parents, Danny was being raised by his older sister, Kathy. She said Danny was her whole world and was devastated when he died.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 17 at the time of his death.\n*He's a fan of hockey.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
