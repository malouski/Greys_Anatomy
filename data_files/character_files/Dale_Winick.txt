When Dale, Andy, and Jack were found, they were brought to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to be treated. However, Lonnie remained missing. At the hospital, when they told the story, they said that Lonnie was dead and they had to leave him behind so they could get to a place where they could be rescued.\n\nDale had severe frostbite on his hands, but no other obvious injuries. His hands were infected, so they took him into surgery, but the infection was too severe and they had to amputate both. ''(\"[[Testing 1-2-3]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek discovered that that story was a lie as the ax was imbedded deeply and cleanly into Lonnie's skull, he confronted the other hikers. Andy started to confess, but was silenced. Andy quickly hired a lawyer to counsel him. However, despite his lawyer's advice, he told what really happened. Lonnie was dying and Andy tried to put him out of his misery. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nDale, Jack, Andy, and Lonnie are friends.
