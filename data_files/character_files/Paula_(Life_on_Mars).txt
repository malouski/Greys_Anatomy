They didn't notice the train pulling away and Brad suddenly fell down onto the tracks, where he was electrocuted. He was taken to the hospital, where they noted that both arms and his left leg were severely burned. They did fasciotomies in the ER before taking him to surgery for that and his head injury. After his surgery, Paula was told he'd need more surgery and would have a long recovery. They warned him that whoever took care of him would need to spend a lot of time in hospitals as he recovered and she decided that she couldn't stay. She wondered what that said about her that she wouldn't stay after he'd decided to give up his dream for her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was dating [[Brad Spencer]].
