She wasn't able to feel the foot and they weren't able to detect a pulse in it. They initially assessed that they'd have to amputate the foot, but when they told her that, she panicked and moved her foot, showing them that she still had nerve function in the foot.\n\nHer parents were called and they were expected to arrive that evening. She was taken into surgery quickly. In surgery, they were able to restore blood flow.\n\n===Plan to Resume Her Sail===\nWhile her parents were talking to the doctors, Emery was online. Someone offered to donate a new boat to her so she could complete her sail. She said if she got back out on the water within two weeks, she'd be able to do it before the weather got bad. However, [[Callie Torres|Dr. Torres]] informed her that if she wanted to get back to full function in her foot, she'd be in the hospital for a while and it would mean a series of big operations, during which she'd have to stay off her feet.\n\nDespite her assurances to Dr. Torres that she'd stay off her feet between operations, Emery accepted a boat from a sailing company and was planning to go back out as soon as she was released from the hospital. Dr. Torres encouraged her mother to \"be the bad guy\" and stop her from sailing to protect her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nEmery's parents were supportive of her desire to sail.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her boat was named Pickle.\n*She was 16 at the time of her accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:James, Emery}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
