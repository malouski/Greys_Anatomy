Daniel meticulously scheduled every minute of the day before and the day of the wedding. When his daughter asked him about lighting a candle for her brother, he brushed it off, saying there wasn't time in the ceremony.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Barbara Robbins]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe is the father of\u00a0[[Arizona Robbins]] and [[Timothy Robbins]]. He is also the grandfather of\u00a0[[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]].\n\nWhen Arizona came out, he was rather accepting, asking if she was still the daughter he raised her to be.\n\nWhen Arizona was a child and they'd move to a new place, he always took her skating, so she'd have something familiar that felt like home. ''(\"[[Fight For Your Mind]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe is a colonel in the US Marine Corps.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Unlike Arizona, Daniel seems to prefer to deal with the loss of Timothy by not talking about him. He didn't include a moment to light a candle for Timothy in the wedding plans of his daughter's wedding, and when Arizona wanted to discuss this, her mother told her not to push it, indicating that Daniel is not comfortable talking about Timothy.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n7x20-14.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[fr:Daniel Robbins]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robbins, Daniel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
