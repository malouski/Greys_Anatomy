He suffers from bronchial tumors that keep growing back.\n\n==History==\n===Earlier Surgeries===\nElliot's bronchial tumors occured for the first time when he was four years old. They removed the tumors, but they recurred. Ever since, they had to debulk the tumors every 7 to 10 days as they compromised his breathing. Over time, he got used to the regular surgeries and his parents bought a house near the hospital so he didn't need to travel much when another surgery was needed. Leah stated that he had had 312 surgeries, which she thought at first couldn't be correct.\n\n===Genome Mapping===\nTo bring a stop to the almost weekly surgeries, Bailey proposed to custom design a drug that would stop the growth of the tumors. To do so, she needed to take a sample of the tumors during another surgery and create a [[Genome Mapping|genome map]] of the tissue, so she could find the specific DNA marker that was responsible for the growth of the tumors. Elliot was extremely happy with the proposal, as it would mean no surgeries ever again.\n\nOutside his room, Leah stood up for herself and Bailey awarded her with allowing her to pull off the entire surgery to collect the samples needed for the genome map. Leah did so successfully with some guidance from Bailey. Later at April's wedding, Bailey showed confidence when she claimed that she would be able to cure Elliot medically if she'd spend a few weeks in her genome lab.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Elliot was the first on-screen patient of Bailey for whom she made a genome map to medically cure a disease. The other maps she made were to practice predictive medicine.\n*It seems somewhat incorrect that Elliot has surgeries every 7 to 10 days, as this would mean 52 to 37 surgeries a year. Knowing that he has had 312 surgeries since he was four years old, six to seven years at the most have passed since he was four years old, but Elliot is way older than 10 or 11.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hooks, Elliot}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Genetics)]]"}}}]}}}}
