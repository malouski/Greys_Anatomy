The light from the ball was visible through his abdomen. They decided to keep him overnight to wait for the object to pass. They did hourly checks to track the progress. When a few checks got skipped, Gary ended up in extreme pain because the device had broken apart and the battery was in danger of causing a perforation. They took him into surgery to remove it.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nGary's parents came to the hospital with him. His father barely looked up from his phone. His mother is his primary caregiver.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 14 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He loves cherries.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\">\n12x03-7.jpg\n12x03-8.jpg\n12x03-9.jpg\n12x03-10.jpg\n12x03-13.jpg\n12x03-18.jpg\n12x03-20.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walton, Gary}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
