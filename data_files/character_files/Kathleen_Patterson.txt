She'd had several other procedures that had failed to restore her speech. In the interim, she'd grown an online community for the voiceless and used post-its with common phrases to communicate.\n\nKathleen went into surgery. Afterward, she refused to try speaking because she was worried. Lexie spoke to her alone, saying she could try it with her and it wouldn't be so bad if it didn't work because she's just an intern. Kathleen shakily said, \"Hi.\" and then began to speak more confidently.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Mr. Patterson (All By Myself)|Mr. Patterson]]. Their relationship was strained by her voicelessness. After her surgery, when she refused to try speaking, he snapped at her, begging her to talk to him. When he later heard her speak, he was delighted.\n\n===Friendships===\nDuring her voicelessness, Kathleen started blogging and grew an online community for those who are voiceless.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Patterson, Kathleen}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]"}}}]}}}}
