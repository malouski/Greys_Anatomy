The scan showed a mass near his heart, a very large one. They did an angiogram to get a better look at the mass, but discovered that it was actually an aneurysm with a fistula into his heart chamber. He was advised that surgery would be extremely risky and it was likely he wouldn't survive it.\n\nHe and his fianc\u00e9e, Amy, discussed whether or not he should have the surgery. He decided to have the surgery and Amy left him. Shortly after she left, Keith crashed and had to be rushed into surgery.\n\nKeith survived his surgery and [[Preston Burke|Burke]] had to break the news to him afterward that Amy was gone.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was engaged to [[Amy (Season 2)|Amy]] until she left him before he had to have an extremely risky surgery, saying she couldn't handle the thought of him dying.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He had no family or personal history of heart disease prior to his heart attack.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Polace, Keith}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
