Alex pulled the spokes out and Meredith grudgingly sewed him up. He was advised that because Meredith wanted to run more tests, if he left, it'd be against medical advice, meaning he'd have to sign a paper, which he did. The following day, he was re-admitted when his stitches had torn apart, his skin was swollen, and he began to cough blood. He went into surgery, but afterwards, he was fine, much to the relief of a group of his waiting friends.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nViper flirted with Meredith in the ER and even kissed her, but he knew she wasn't interested in him.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n103-4.jpg\n103-5.jpg\n103-7.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:Viper]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
