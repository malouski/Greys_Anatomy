She noticed that he was wearing a hat from Case Western Reserve and noted that she'd just been offered a job there. He was disappointed, as he'd been waiting to hear about a job.\n\nLater that night, Kevin approached April at a bar. He implied that she only got the job because the man who hired her wanted to sleep with her. She attacked him. They fought until [[Richard Webber|Richard]] came in and broke up the fight.\n\n==Career==\nKevin Banks is a surgical resident. He was set to take his boards. Since he and April were up for the same spot at Case Western, it can be assumed that he was planning to be a trauma surgeon.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Banks, Kevin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
