When his wife became distant and started talking about not having the mastectomy, he became concerned. He asked Bailey to talk to Anna, but Bailey had been accused of being too emotional with patients and declined, saying it wasn't her place. However, when he became even more concerned about his wife not wanting to fight the cancer at all, he went to Bailey again.\n\nBailey talked to Anna and then watched Gus while his parents talked. She said they were leaning toward the mastectomy.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Anna Nyles]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe has one son, Gus. He was concerned when Anna refused to hold Gus while she was hospitalized. When he mentioned that Gus wasn't taking the bottle well after Anna had to quit breastfeeding, Bailey suggested that he try a little bit of sugar water on the tip just until he got used to it. Mr. Nyles said it worked well.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n3x05-1.jpg\n3x05-10.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nyles, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
