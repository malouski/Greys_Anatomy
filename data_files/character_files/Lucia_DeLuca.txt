Later, at a cousin's wedding, she stabbed her husband in his hand. ''(\"[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]\")''\n\n===Christmas Surprise===\nOne year, while her husband was manic, he spent all their Christmas money. Lucia saved up and bought one present to surprise her children with, a pair of roller skates. Andrew tried to give them to Carina, but she put on one and had him put on the other and they each held up their other leg and skated around the house together. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n===Move to the United States===\nWhen her children were still young, Lucia and her husband, Vincenzo, decided to divorce. Lucia wanted to move to the United States for a fresh start. Vincenzo declared that he would rather their family be split up, so Carina told her mother to take Andrew to the US with her and leave Carina in Italy with her father. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")'' She then took Andrew to Wisconsin, where he grew up. Carina was sixteen when her mother left to go to the United States. ''(\"[[Comfortably Numb]]\")''\n\n===Death===\nLucia died unexpectedly while in Italy. Her daughter lied to her son, saying their mom was merely sick, and waited until he was in Italy to tell him in person that she was dead.\n\n===Posthumous History===\nWhen Andrew had been stabbed and was having surgery, he imagined himself on a beach with Meredith, who was in a coma due to COVID-19. After some time on the beach, he heard his mother calling out to him. He told Meredith he needed to go with her and they walked off together. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to [[Vincenzo DeLuca]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and Vincenzo had two children: Carina and Andrew. She called them two parts of a whole.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She is the only character who was seen on Meredith's beach who did not make any previous appearance on the show.\n*According to [[Maggie Pierce]] in [[Undo]], DeLuca's mother was \"probably at work\" during his assault and that she knows her. This is a major storyline inconsistency. Showrunner [[Krista Vernoff]] eventually addressed the discrepancy in a tweet saying they had simply forgotten and suggested it be amended as Maggie knowing his stepmother.<ref>https://twitter.com/KristaVernoff/status/1103513771807395841?s=20</ref>\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:DeLuca, Lucia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
