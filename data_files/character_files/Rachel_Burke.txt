They had spent $5,000 on equipment because Scott always wanted to try camping, though Rachel admitted she would have preferred to go to Italy. They saw the crew of station 19 as the walked through toward their own campsite. The next morning, the firefighters were awakened by screams coming from the Burkes' camp. He had been making coffee when a black bear attacked them, tearing off Scott's nose and severing an artery in Rachel's arm. The team put a tourniquet on Rachel's arm, packed Scott's face, and then carried them down to the parking lot, where the ambulance picked them up and took them to the hospital. The nose was later located and taken to the hospital so it could be reattached. ''(\"[[Into the Woods]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, Rachel and Scott both immediately went into surgery. Rachel's brachial artery was repaired and Scott's nose was temporarily attached to his arm, so that his face would have time to heal before it was reattached there. Rachel had to have a second surgery the next day to wash out her wounds to prevent infection. She was told she'd be okay after some rehab. Scott, on the other hand, coded after his surgery due to bleeding in his chest and wasn't able to be resuscitated. Rachel was devastated to learn he'd died and pushed Brian, her secret lover, away.
