A CT scan showed no acute injury, but Alex smelled meth on him, so he said he needed to run more tests and ordered an MRI and a tox screen, which revealed that he'd ingested meth, probably due to it coating the floors and walls of his home when his parents were making it. He started to go into withdrawal at the hospital. When his father found out the doctors knew he'd been cooking meth, he tried to take Brian and hide, but they were discovered in the bathroom attached to his mother's hospital room, limp in his father's arms. He'd had a stroke, so he was rushed into surgery. His surgery went well and his grandmother came to take custody of him because his parents were being arrested.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nBrian's mother, [[Marla Kristler|Marla]], and his father, [[Dave Kristler|Dave]], were running a meth lab in their apartment. It blew up, sending the family to Seattle Grace Hospital.\n\nBrian has a grandmother who took care of him after his parents were taken into custody.\n\n===Friendships===\n[[Archie Roche]] sometimes babysat him and was shocked to learn about the meth lab.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\nHe was 18 months old at the time of his surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kristler, Brian}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
