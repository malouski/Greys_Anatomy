While she was trying to draw blood for tests, [[Sadie Harris|Sadie]] poked Lorraine several times. Izzie ultimately let Sadie do a draw on her to show her how before trying again with Lorraine. Lorraine's lab results then showed signs of cancer, so they got her an oncology consult.

She'd had $80,000 worth of medical tests and after all that, it turned out she didn't have cancer. She was only anemic. Her lawyer believed that someone at the clinic had switched her blood sample with someone else's. He told her not to go back, but her conscience wanted to make sure Izzie found out who actually had cancer.
