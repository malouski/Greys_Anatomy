However, he decided to do the work himself instead of hiring professionals and ended up crushing his hand with a sandblaster. His x-ray didn't show any fractures, but he had swelling and pain. They did a CT, which showed a displaced fracture of the hook of the hamate, so they took him into surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, Manoj was told he would make a full recovery, though it would take a few months to get the feeling back. He was told he'd need occupational therapy, but he said he had his own exercise regimen. He then shared with the doctors his secret. He said he asks his clients what they want and he listens to them.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a sex therapist. His business improved during the 2020 pandemic.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He had a narrowing of his ulnar artery, which Jackson said he saw often in patients who used vibrating power tools.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joshi, Manoj}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
