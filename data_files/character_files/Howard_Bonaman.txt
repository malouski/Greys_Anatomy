Because of this, Howard planned exciting trips to fill that space.\n\nOn one of those trips, duck hunting, Howard accidentally shot Brenda in the neck. She was rushed to the ER and then immediately to the OR. Before they anesthetized her for her surgery, she complained of abdominal pain and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] discovered that she was about to give birth, despite believing she couldn't conceive. Before she could have her surgery, they needed her to give birth, so she was instructed to push. The pushing caused one of the pellets in her neck to dislodge and travel to her heart, causing arrhythmias. She was unable to see or hold her daughter before they had to anesthetize her for surgery. Despite some complications, her surgery went well and she was able to meet her daughter when she woke up. Howard was shocked when he was told that he had a daughter.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Brenda Bonaman]]. Together, they have one daughter.\n\n===Familial===\nHoward and Brenda believed she couldn't get pregnant, so they filled their lives with as much excitement as they could. When she did become pregnant, she went the duration of the pregnancy without knowing she was pregnant until she went into labor at the hospital and gave birth to a healthy baby girl.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x11-2.jpg\n11x11-4.jpg\n11x11-9.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bonaman, Howard}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
