At the hospital, he was confused and disoriented. He believed he was on a plane when he was in the CT scanner. His sodium was also low. The scan revealed a Rathke's cleft cyst, which made him excessively thirsty, which is why his sodium was low. Derek ordered hypertonic saline to treat the sodium imbalance. Robert began to search rabidly for water, even drinking from the toilet. They had to turn the water off in his room to get him to stop. Alex then related the order for hypertonic saline, but got the numbers wrong and ordered too much, which severely dehydrated Martin's brain. Martin had a seizure and couldn't have his surgery. ''(\"[[Much too Much]]\")''\n\nRobert remained in a coma after his seizure and it was unlikely that he would come out. Alex did research to look for options for him, but Derek said it wouldn't work. Alex sat with him anyway, saying no one should die alone. ''(\"[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\")''\n\nBailey later told George, after he made a joke about Alex, that Alex had made a mistake which killed a patient, indicating that Robert had died. ''(\"[[Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nHe had no friends or family members. His only company was his assistant, [[Doyle]], who came to the hospital with him. He later fired Doyle, saying that once people see you as sick, they don't see anything else.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 45 at the time of his death.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n210RobertMartin.png|[[Much too Much]]\n211RobertMartin.png|[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Robert Martin Appearances}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martin, Robert}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
