They were taken to the ER, where Michael died. Because she was covered in blood, Wendy was given a set of scrubs to wear.\n\nWendy was given the form to claim Michael's personal belongings, but didn't know what to do with it, so she asked [[Ben Warren]] who, mistaking her for an intern, gave her samples from [[Brenda Bonaman]] that needed to be sent to the lab. Wendy left the samples on a shelf and wandered around the hospital. She took a nap in [[Chapel|the chapel]], visited the babies, and ate in the cafeteria.\n\nAt the end of the day, she was found out when [[April Kepner]] saw her and didn't recognize her. When pressed, she confessed what had happened and said that when she got the form to claim his belongings, she wasn't ready to take them and go home. April told her that she was strong and that she could do it.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was engaged to a man named Michael until his death in a car accident.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She believes in God, but her fianc\u00e9 did not.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
