Addison planned an EXIT surgery. They removed the baby partially to operate because the tumor was obstructing her airway. That would allow her to keep getting oxygen through the umbilical cord while they removed the tumor.\n\nWhile Cheyenne was waiting for her surgery, she was reading Shakespeare to the baby. Izzie talked to her and suggested adoption as an option to her, knowing that it's not something that's discussed where they come from.\n\nAfter the surgery, Cheyenne held the baby and talked to Izzie about her experience giving her baby up for adoption.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nCheyenne was raised by her mother in a trailer park. When Cheyenne was pregnant, she was supposed to start saving up to get her own trailer for her and the baby.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe has a friend named Shelly who lives in the same trailer park where [[Izzie Stevens]] grew up.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wood, Cheyenne}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]"}}}]}}}}
