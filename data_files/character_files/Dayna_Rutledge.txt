Despite the hack, she was in such advanced labor that the hospital had to take her in. She wanted painkillers, but because of the hack, they didn't have access to any of that, so Carina suggested that Dayna initiate orgasm to relieve some of her pain. After that suggestion, Peggy refused to listen to her and when the power went out for a minute, Peggy decided to try to leave. However, Arizona examined her and determined the baby was already crowning, so Arizona coached her through pushing and her baby was born. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\n===Cancer Diagnosis and Car Accident===\nDayna had an inconclusive mammogram and was referred to [[Scott Hanson]] for a second opinion. He diagnosed her with stage II breast cancer and started her on chemotherapy. He also promised her she'd get through it. After her second round, she projectile vomited in the car, causing her wife to serve and hit a tree. She was taken to the ER, where they did a CT scan that didn't show any evidence of cancer, raising suspicion. After scheduling a fake appointment where she, too, was diagnosed with cancer, Arizona, along with Owen, decided they needed to stop Hanson. While Owen confronted him and called the police, Arizona showed Dayna and Peggy Dayna's real scans and told her she didn't actually have cancer, which they both celebrated. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\n===Weed Cookies===\nTo express their gratitude, Peggy and Dayna gave Arizona some cookies. They later paged her because they realized they had used peanut butter with marijuana left over from Dayna's chemotherapy.
