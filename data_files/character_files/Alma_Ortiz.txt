She later transferred her residency so she could work at the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]].\n\n==History==\n===Internship===\nDue to the growing Covid-19 pandemic, Alma and her fellow medical school graduates were sent to their residency programs earlier than the standard start date. They arrived on the first day and were welcomed reluctantly by [[Tom Koracick]]. When he learned there were two Drs. Ortiz, he suggested Big O and Little O as nicknames. He then left them tape and a marker to make name tags for themselves before leaving them.\n\nAlma was supposed to be in the ER, but when one intern, Jenson, quit after two hours, she ended up on discharges. She refused to discharge a patient to a nursing home that was overrun with Covid cases, saying she wanted to speak to the patient's doctor, Meredith, before doing anything further.\n\nAt the end of the day, Richard Webber took Alma, along with her daughter, Sara, and [[Reza Khan]], into an OR, where he gave them a modified version of his traditional intern speech. He told them he'd make sure they learned as much as possible and promised them they'd get through it together. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nWhen [[Marcella Diaz|Marcella]] and [[Veronica Diaz]] ended up at the hospital at the same time, Alma ended up treating Veronica. Alma comforted Veronica when she expressed regret at having passed COVID-19 to her mother, assuring her that her mother would never regret hugging her. Later, when both mother and daughter declined and needed ventilators, and only one was available, Alma said the protocol was to use it on the person with a better chance of survival, meaning Veronica. With that decided, they put Veronica on the ventilator. However, Maggie then had an idea to use a y-shaped tube to split the ventilator power so both of them could use a single machine. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nWhen the Catherine Fox Foundation sponsored a free COVID testing day at the hospital, Alma helped swab patients as they came through. She became irritated when she learned that Jackson was renting hotel rooms for patients who tested positive but had difficulty isolating from family members who weren't infected. She told him that him booking hotel rooms at full rate ousted charities who were renting them at a discounted rate to help unhoused people. He ended up having her make a list of things she would do if she had the capital, as she had the knowledge of how to help people most effectively. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n===Transferring===\nAlma later transferred her residency to Boston so she could take a job with the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]]. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe and her daughter went through medical school at the same time and matched to Grey Sloan Memorial together.\n\n==Career==\nShe was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. When [[Jackson Avery]] took over the [[Catherine Fox Foundation]], she transferred to Boston so she could take a job with the Foundation. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")'' Prior to going to medical school, she was a social worker for 20 years.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n17x03AlmaOrtiz.png|[[My Happy Ending]]\n17x10AlmaOrtiz.png|[[Breathe]]\n17x11AlmaOrtiz.png|[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Alma Ortiz Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ortiz, Alma}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
