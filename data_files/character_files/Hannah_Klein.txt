Izzie encountered Hannah's parents at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and found out\u00a0that she had leukemia. Izzie then donated bone marrow to Hannah to save her life.\n\n==History==\n===Birth===\n[[File:HannahKlein.jpg|thumb|left|A picture of her when she was six.]]\n[[Izzie Stevens]] got pregnant at 15. Being unable to care for the child she gave birth to, she placed her for adoption at age 16. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n===Cancer===\nYears later, Hannah's parents came to the hospital looking specifically for Izzie, as Hannah had leukemia. Initially reluctant to do anything for Hannah as she would only be, at best, a half match for Hannah, she eventually decided to go through with a bone marrow donation.\n\nIzzie asked to see Hannah after the procedure and her parents agreed to ask her, but they came back and said that she was tired. Izzie did, however, get a glimpse of her in her hospital bed through the windows during the transfusion.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her parents named her Hannah, but Izzie privately named her Sarah.\n*Hannah loves pigs; she has earrings, stuffed animals, and many other pig accessories. Izzie speculates that it is because her mother used to read ''Charlotte's Web'' to her.\n\n[[de:Hannah Klein]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Klein, Hannah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
