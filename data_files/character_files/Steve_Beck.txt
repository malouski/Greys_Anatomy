[[Callie Torres]] reduced his knee and ordered post-reduction films and labs.\n\nThe labs showed that he was severely dehydrated, so they gave him fluids to re-hydrate him. He mentioned that his knee and calves were sore. Cristina examined them and saw extremely swelling. Callie and Cristina did bilateral fasciotomies to relieve the pressure. His kidneys were failing. Callie put together that the aspirin he'd taken that morning for the cold he had had progressed his symptoms. [[Richard Webber]] placed a dialysis catheter and ordered dialysis to pull the toxins out of his blood.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 32 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He's won two marathons.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n3x13-28.jpg\n3x13-29.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beck, Steve}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
