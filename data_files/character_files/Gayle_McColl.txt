He had an intracranial bleed as well as being electrocuted. While he had brain surgery on the bleed, Nathan inserted a pacemaker to regulate his heartbeat. After his surgery, they told [[Lena]], whom they believed was his wife, about his condition. However, Gayle arrived and informed them that she was Griffin's wife and Lena was just his girlfriend. Griffin was worth a lot of money and so Gayle refused to divorce him due to a pre-nuptual agreement that meant she wouldn't get his money unless they were married when he died.\n\nGriffin woke up after his surgery, confused and believing that he and Gayle were still together. He was shocked that they weren't and had no memory of Lena or their relationship. While they were talking about their life together, Griffin started to go weak. Penny examined him and found that his ICP was increasing. She did a ventriculostomy in his room and then he was rushed into surgery for a re-bleed. Despite their best efforts, he died in surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to [[Griffin McColl]] until his death, though they'd been separated for 33 years. She says that he was sweet and then his money turned him into someone she couldn't love. When he woke up after his surgery, he had memory loss that made him forget that they'd ever split. He called her the funniest woman he'd ever met. After his brief time conscious after surgery, she realized she loved him and just wanted a chance to love him again. However, he died in a second surgery.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*According to Griffin, she has the softest hands.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McColl, Gayle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
