The growth was easily removed and he was told it would heal quickly, but once his son and daughter-in-law were out of the room, he confessed that he was really there to have a penis pump implanted to combat his erectile dysfunction. He was seeing a woman in his retirement home and didn't want to disappoint her. When his son and daughter-in-law heard what he wanted to do, they tried to talk him out of it. They worried about his health, but he was cleared for surgery. His son then said they'd talked about it and if he had the surgery, they'd force him to move home. [[Mark Sloan]] then stood up for him, saying that he'd taken care of his family and now they need to take care of him.\n\nHis surgery went well and Marion came to visit him in the hospital afterward.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married for many years to a woman named Sylvie. More than 20 years after she died, he started seeing a woman in his nursing home, Marion. They met while playing [[Bingo]]. He had a device implanted into his penis in order to be able to have sex with her.\n\n===Familial===\nHis son and daughter-in-law were concerned when he wanted the surgery. They tried to talk him out of it and then tried to force him to move in with them. However, they eventually understood and accepted that he wanted it.\n\nHe has a granddaughter, Janey, whom he says is pretty, but not that bright.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 82 at the time of his penis implant surgery.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" bordersize=\"none\">\n6x04-6.jpg\n6x04-7.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Waller, Irving}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]"}}}]}}}}
