He received a kidney from [[Lindsay Herman]].\n\n==History==\nKurt Walling was in chronic renal failure secondary to diabetes which required dialysis four times a week. In order to get a kidney transplant, he offered his son, [[P.J. Walling|P.J.]], $10,000 to join a domino kidney transplant. P.J. donated a kidney to [[Stan Mercer]] and Kurt received one from [[Lindsay Herman]].\n\nThe transplant went well, but Kurt had a seizure and delayed graft function post-op.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis relationship with his son, [[P.J. Walling]], is strained. His mother died and his father worked all the time. When Kurt needed a kidney transplant, it took him months to find his son because they hadn't spoken in over a year. When Kurt wasn't doing well post-op, P.J. was warned that this might be his last change to get to know his father.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 58 at the time of his kidney transplant.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n5x05-21.jpg\n5x05-23.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walling, Kurt}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
