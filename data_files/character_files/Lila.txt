She was upset because she said this couldn't be the way she died as she was supposed to go to Brazil next week. She had Huntington's disease. Her mother had died of it, so she got tested and found out she had it as well. She said she could accept that she was going to die, but she couldn't die doing laundry.\n\nHer scans showed a diaphragmatic rupture, which allowed her stomach to go into the chest cavity. They planned to put her stomach back and repair the defect. When Lila signed the consent form for her surgery, Meredith noticed that she had chorea in her hand. She said it had started a few months ago, but she hadn't told her doctors.\n\nHer surgery went well and Meredith gave her medicine for the chorea. She said she'd need to see her doctor for a refill once she returned from her trip.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother died of Huntington's when she was 45.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was around 35 at the time of her hospitalization.\n*She learned how to say, \"Do you have a condom?\" in Portuguese before travelling to Brazil.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
