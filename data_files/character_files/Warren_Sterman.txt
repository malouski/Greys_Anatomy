He ended up quitting his last year of clinics and instead went into medical research.\n\n===Bowel Obstruction===\nHe developed a bowel obstruction, for which he required surgery. After his surgery, it took a while for his bowel to start working again, so he had to stay an extra night. He eventually did have a bowel movement, meaning he could be discharged. ''(\"[[Shake Your Groove Thing]]\")''\n\nOver the next several years, he continued to see Bailey every few years to have another portion of his bowel removed.

''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\n===Dancing Cult===\nWarren was heard some noise one morning and learned that a local cult leader, [[Brother John]], was on the roof leading the crowd in a dance, he called emergency services. When the firefighters arrived, Warren went to the scene and introduced himself. He said the followers weren't grounded in reality and would do whatever John told them to do. He also later warned them to look out for John, as he appeared crazy, but was really dangerous as he was charming. ''(\"[[Learning to Fly]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married. His marriage was in trouble for a while after he finished medical school. That's part of the reason why he switched to medical research.\n\n==Career==\nWarren does medical research.
