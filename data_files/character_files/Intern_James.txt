She told him to continue to give reports. ''(\"[[What's Inside]]\")''\n\nHe sat in the gallery to observe the surgery on [[Catherine Fox|Catherine's]] chondrosarcoma until Richard decided to close the gallery. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe is a surgical intern at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Given the in-universe time difference between his two appearances, James would have been a resident by his second appearance (as he started out with Andrew). However, credits in his second appearance indicate that he is still an intern at the time, meaning he might have failed his intern exam and had to repeat his intern year like [[George O'Malley]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x19InternJames.png|[[What's Inside]]\n15x11InternJames.png|[[The Winner Takes It All]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Intern James Appearances}}{{DEFAULTSORT:James}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
