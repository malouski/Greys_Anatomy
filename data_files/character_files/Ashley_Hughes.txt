She had crush injuries and both her hips were dislocated, while he had only a head laceration. She said her legs were on his shoulders and her feet were in the air when he slipped and fell on her, crushing her due to his much larger size.\n\nIn the ER, she was maxed out on pain meds, but still in extreme pain. Callie offered her the option to have her hips reduced in the ER to reduce her pain instead of putting her under anesthesia to do it. She went for it and they reduced her hips.\n\nThey took her for a CT, which revealed a break in her femur that the first set of films hadn't shown. Her right leg was also cold and pale from lack of blood flow. They rushed her into surgery, where they restored blood flow and fixed her femur.\n\nAfter surgery, she had a pulmonary embolism which required an embolectomy. After that procedure, she was told she'd be fine.\n\nWhen Christopher came to visit her in her room, she said she didn't need to climb Everest a second time, ending things with him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe described [[Christopher]] as funny, cute, and sweet. Despite his large size, she decided she was up for the challenge. However, when they had sex, she was seriously injured when he fell on her. She then told him she didn't need to climb Everest a second time, ending things with him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She ran the New York State Marathon faster than anyone else in her age group.\n*She was 21 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hughes, Ashley}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
