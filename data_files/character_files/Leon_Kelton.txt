He fell four stories and was impaled on standing rebar. Despite being impaled on three metal bars, he was optimistic, saying that if they hadn't caught him, he'd be a stain on the pavement. He was taken directly to the OR from the ER.\n\nOne of the poles was near his carotid, but hadn't severed it. One was in the right upper quadrant and had likely missed his liver. And his femoral artery was intact. Because the bars were rough metal, they risked further damage pulling them out. They tried bone cutters to cut the bars close to his body, but they didn't work. Leon, who was still conscious, told them that they needed a 4.5\" angle grinder with a cutoff wheel. However, just before they began to cut the bar, Owen and Ben came into the OR and stopped them, saying that the grinding metal would cause sparks, which, given the oxygen flow in the OR, could cause a serious fire.\n\nThey figured out they could remove as much oxygen as possible from the room and manually ventilate him then cut until his oxygen dropped too low. It took them a while, but they finally cut through the bars and were able to proceed with the surgery.\n\nAll in all, it was an uncomplicated surgery. Post-op, Leon was awake and doing well.\n\n==Career==\nLeon is a construction worker. While working on a roof, he was blown off the building onto standing rebar.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 39 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*Owen gave him one of the bars after the surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kelton, Leon}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
