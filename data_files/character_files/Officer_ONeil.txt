Arizona, Eliza, and Meredith ran to the door, but he stopped them because of the lockdown. Bailey opened the door and said she needed their help, telling him to let them in.\n\nAfter the staff had been briefed on the fire, O'Neil told Bailey they were still looking for the rapist.\n\nWhen Ben learned that he'd seen the rapist with Stephanie, he offered to show them where that happened. [[Firefighter Carroll]] said it was too dangerous, but O'Neil thought it was a good idea. While they debated, Ben took a coat and walked into the building. O'Neil and his crew followed.\n\nInside the building, they found the source of the explosion and found Keith's body on the floor. Ben knew it was too tall to be Stephanie and then he found a blood path that led them up to the roof, where [[Erin Miller|Erin]] and [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] were.\n\n==Career==\nHe works for the Seattle Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:O'Neil, Officer}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Police Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
