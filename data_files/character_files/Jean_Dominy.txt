In that time, they had a whole lifetime's worth of memories, including having 3 children and 7 grandchildren.\n\n===Hip Replacement===\nFifteen years prior to her second hip surgery, she had had a hip replacement.\n\n===Heart Problems===\nJean had heart surgery to have a stent placed. She was also put on blood thinners to prevent clots.\n\n===Hip Injury===\nA week after being discharged, Jean came back to the hospital after the earthquake. She had fallen on her hip while having sex during the earthquake, so she came into the ER. In the ER, Maggie cleared her heart and Callie examined her hip. There was severe bruising, so Callie ordered x-rays, which revealed a below the stem femur fracture. Callie's initial plan meant replacing the hardware and extending the stem to cover the break. However, Maggie said it wasn't the best idea given her recent heart troubles. Callie agreed to look at the scans again. When she did, she said that Jean definitely needed surgery, but instead of replacing the hip again, she could place a plate, a shorter surgery. The surgery was successful and when she woke up, Jean was told she'd need to wait eight weeks to put her new hip to work.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====Husband====\nShe was married for 44 years until her husband died. She stated he's the only man she's ever loved and the only man she'll ever love.\n\n====Other Men====\nAfter her husband died, Jean decided that she still have a lot of time left and a lot of things she wanted to do, so she sought out sexual partners. One of them is Herbert, who lives down the hall from her, with whom she was having sex when she fell. Edward and Irving, as well as an unnamed man with a bad toupee, were also listed among her lovers.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband had three children and seven grandchildren.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 75 at the time of her hip injury.\n*She had a book with all the sexual positions. She was doing number 28 with Herbert when the earthquake hit.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dominy, Jean}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
