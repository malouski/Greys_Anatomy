She had a recurrent vaginal tumor and had been treated with chemo and radiation, but was ultimately told she'd need to have most of her lower internal organs removed, including her uterus. In order to preserve her fertility, Catherine developed a variation which would allow her to keep her uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. However, during her surgery, Catherine discovered that the tissue was too friable and she was forced to perform a hysterectomy. After her surgery, Catherine broke the news to Uma, who was visibly upset.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 25 at the time of her surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paxton, Uma}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]"}}}]}}}}
