They had to rush him inside when they saw an out-of-control ambulance driving into the ambulance bay. However, he still got a piece of shrapnel lodged in his tibia.\n\nThey took him into the ER, where they diagnosed a sternal infection. Erica asked Mark if he could help her remove his sternum and use the muscles in his chest to cover the gap. Mark agreed. They told Jacob he'd be taken into surgery to remove his sternum as well as the shrapnel in his leg.\n\nIn surgery, they were able to remove the shrapnel and start work on his heart, removing the infected sternum and then covering the gap. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part 1]]\")''\n\nRight when they prepared to close, one of the grafts blew and they had to rush to stop the bleeding. Erica then repaired the damage and replaced the graft.\n\nAfter surgery, he was stable and recovering.
