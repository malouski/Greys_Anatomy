The last person to be holding the dress won a $100,000 wedding package. While they were competing, she got into a fight with [[Jackie Escott]], another contestant, as they were the last two left standing. Even though they were both injured, they refused to let go of the dress and had to be brought to the hospital in the same ambulance.\n\nHelena's nose was broken and her face and scalp were lacerated. Once they were able to convince them to separate by allowing George to act as a proxy for Jackie. Once Jackie was gone, [[Mark Sloan]] stitched up Helena's head. Then she and George continued to hold the dress. She admitted to him that the big wedding was her mother's dream, not hers. Her mother is the manager of a grocery story and she's been putting herself into debt over getting everything she wanted for Helena's wedding. While they were talking, Helena collapsed and had to be rushed into surgery with abdominal bleeding.\n\nShe woke up after surgery and was told that she won, because George let go in order to catch her. The contest judge gave her the check and left.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is engaged to [[Jason]].\n\n===Familial===\nHer father left her and her mother. Since then, Helena's wedding has been her mother's dream.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 26 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x06-2.jpg\n4x06-4.jpg\n4x06-6.jpg\n4x06-9.jpg\n4x06-10.jpg\n4x06-11.jpg\n4x06-15.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boye, Helena}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
