Pete told her that when all of the shooting stuff was over, they needed to do it again and invite the doctors to it.\n\n===Bank Robbery===\nBoth of Mrs. Gibson's sons, Pete and Brett, responded when a bank was robbed at gunpoint. They were brought into the hospital and she was told that they were both stable. Brett was taken into surgery, so she stayed with Pete and talked to him while he was waiting to go to surgery. However, he arrested while he was waiting. They were able to restore a heartbeat, but he'd been without oxygen for 14 minutes and he was declared brain dead. Brett's surgery went well, but just as they were finishing, he threw a clot and had a stroke, leaving him brain dead as well. Mrs. Gibson was left having to choose whether to donate Pete and Brett's organs. She said they would want to help people, so she agreed to donate, but backed out when [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] asked her to do a directed donation of Brett's liver to Jared, one of the suspects in the bank robbery. However, after [[Dan Pruitt]] spoke to her about Jared, a 15 year old he had Brett had been trying to get back on the right path, she agreed to allow them to take Brett's liver. After the organ harvesting was over, she was given a list of 100 people who got a second chance today because of her sons, the recipients of their organs. Jackson then worked on her son's bodies to make them look as good as possible for her when she saw them for the last time.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe had two sons, Brett and Pete, who were both police officers. They were both declared brain dead after being shot during a bank robbery and she had to make the difficult choice to donate their organs.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gibson, Mrs.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
