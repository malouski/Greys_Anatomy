When his daughter, Erin, was pronounced brain dead after a car accident, he was informed he could do a directed donation of her heart to himself. He was upset and refused to take her heart, telling them to give it to someone else. However, after [[George O'Malley]] spoke to him and said he'd have given his own heart to keep his father alive if he could have and he believed Erin would have done the same, Jack agreed to take his daughter's heart. The transplant went well and Jack was stable afterward.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nJack was devastated when his daughter, Erin, was declared brain dead after a car accident.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x05-9.jpg\n4x05-14.jpg\n4x05-19.jpg\n4x05-22.jpg\n4x05-38.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shandley, Jack}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
