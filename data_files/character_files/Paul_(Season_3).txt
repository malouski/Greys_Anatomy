Violet then ordered him to have sex with his wife, whether or not he was in the mood.\n\nThey reported back that he had erectile dysfunction, so Sam agreed to run tests to look for a physical problem.\n\nPaul came in for a physical exam and was upset because Kathy hadn't come home the night before and he worried she had cheated. Kathy came in in the middle of the exam and said she hadn't cheated. Kathy then left the exam room for the waiting room after saying she was stuck with Paul. Sam drew blood for labs. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part 1]]\")''\n\nPaul's tests showed a hormone imbalance, which was why he didn't want to have sex. Sam said there were many options for why his hormones were imbalanced, so final diagnosis could take a while. Sam did an MRI and consulted with Dr. Straley from Sloan Kettering. He had a tumor on his adrenal gland, which was causing his low sex drive. He was informed that tumors of that type were usually aggressive and found late, so treatment was difficult and risky, but there was hope.
