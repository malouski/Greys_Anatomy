When it became clear that he was going to die soon, Carmen asked to hold him. She held him and accepted that she'd never get to see him grow up. Just as she did that, a heart transplant came through and saved his life.\n\nAs a teenager, the mitral valve in his heart began to fail. Rather than going back on the donor list and waiting for a heart that he may never get, they decided to have [[Cristina Yang]] replace the valve. The surgery was unsuccessful and he was instead put on the donor list.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Larry Hall]]====\nShe is married to Larry Hall and they have [[Michael Hall|one son]] together.\n\n===Familial===\n====[[Michael Hall]]====\nCarmen was told when Michael was an infant that he wouldn't live without a heart transplant, which was unlikely to come through in time. She asked to hold him as he died and she sat and rocked his tiny body until, at the last minute, a heart came through and he lived. As a teen, his mitral valve was failing. Rather than put him back on the donor list, the family decided to have [[Cristina Yang]] perform a valve replacement. However, when she operated, she found she could not complete the operation and told the family they needed to put Michael on the donor list.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x03-1.jpg\n10x03-3.jpg\n10x03-5.jpg\n10x03-8.jpg\n10x03-12.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hall, Carmen}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
