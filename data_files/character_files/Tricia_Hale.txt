She was brought to the hospital with a facial laceration and several lower limb injuries. She was concerned about her face and wanted [[Mark Sloan|the head of plastic surgery]] to look at it personally.\n\nMark stitched up her face and [[Callie Torres]] told her that she had leg and knee fractures as well as a cracked coccyx. She'd need surgery, during which they'd fix her leg, butt, and face at the same time. The surgery went well and she was told she'd be back to normal in a few weeks.\n\nShe was upset because before her surgery, [[Ariana]] told her that she'd be taking over as Cheer Captain while Tricia recovered. After her surgery, Callie told her about being fired as Chief Resident, their version of Cheer Captain, and how it allowed her to get back to what she really loves.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nA boy named Randy was supposed to be taking her to Homecoming. [[Ariana]] said she called him and thought she convinced him still to take her even though she was injured.\n\n===Friendships===\nHer friends, [[Ariana]], [[Courtney (Forever Young)|Courtney]], and [[Molly (Forever Young)|Molly]], visited her in her hospital room after the accident.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 17 at the time of the accident.\n*She's a pom and team captain.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hale, Tricia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
