Carmen came to the hospital one day to check on Luna. She visited regularly over six weeks to check on Luna's status and sign required paperwork. When Luna developed pneumonia due to worsening gastroesophageal reflux, Cormac suggested a surgery that could help her, but Carmen refused to consent. She also noted that she was sad to see that Jo's application to become Luna's legal guardian had been declined as it was a nice thought. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nBy August 2020, Carmen agreed to the surgery after all. It went well and Luna started eating without problems. During one of her visits, Carmen shared with Cormac and Jo that she had found a family that was willing to foster to adopt Luna, though they had requested a timeline. Cormac told her it was too early to tell. Carmen asked him to keep her updated. Eventually, [[Atticus Lincoln]] ended up fostering Luna on paper while [[Jo Wilson|Jo]] did all the work all the while fighting a legal battle to adopt Luna after all. She won and custody was officially transferred from Link to Jo. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nShe is a social worker. Given her packed schedule, she shows little empathy for the children assigned to her.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n17x16CarmenDelgado.png|[[I'm Still Standing]]\n17x17CarmenDelgado.png|[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Carmen Delgado Appearances}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
