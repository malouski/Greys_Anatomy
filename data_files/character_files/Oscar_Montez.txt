Sam came in to draw his blood for pre-op labs, but she had trouble getting a good stick. Alex came in and took over and did it himself.  Sam did report and said he needed to have an open surgery due to adhesions. Sam and Levi both vie for the opportunity to scrub in and Alex tells Oscar he'll be taken for surgery soon.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 16 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Montez}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:Webisode Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
