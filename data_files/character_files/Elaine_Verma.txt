She was admitted to the hospital when she had spasms that caused her legs to jerk involuntarily and she needed a procedure to control the pain. During the consult, Derek asked if she'd considered a cystoplasty, which would enlarge her bladder and create a stoma, negating the need for a catheter and giving her more independence. Her mother was reluctant and said she didn't need it.\n\nBecause Nicole was 18, under the guise of getting more tests, Derek had Alex take Nicole on a walk without her parents. He talked to her while they were walking and she eventually decided she wanted the surgery even though her mother didn't want it.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Mr. Verma]]. Together, they have one child.\n\n===Familial===\nShe is very protective of her daughter, Nicole. She made many of her decisions for her and decided against a procedure that would give her more independence from her parents.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Verma, Elaine}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
