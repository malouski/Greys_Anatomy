When they went to leave, their rig exploded. Jonathan and Ted were both rushed inside the hospital for treatment.\n\nJonathan had serious abdominal bleeding from a liver laceration as well as a depressed skull fracture. They used a wound vacuum to close his abdomen with the intent of going in the next day to repair the damage. Amelia also placed a ventriculostomy in his head.\n\nThe next day, they took him into surgery. His ventriculostomy was easily removed, but when they went to remove the wound vacuum, he started bleeding profusely. Owen and Nathan quickly did a venovenous bypass, which was successful and allowed them to repair his liver.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a paramedic in [[Seattle]]. [[Paramedic Ted]] is his partner.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Todd, Jonathan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Paramedics]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
