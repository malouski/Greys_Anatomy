Veronica was concerned because her mother was alone during the pandemic, so for her mother's birthday, she went over to her mother's house and cooked for her. They wore masks and ate outside and tried to stay distanced, but Veronica gave her mother a hug, which unknowingly transmitted COVID-19 to her. Veronica had a mild case, but her mother quickly ended up in the hospital with difficulty breathing. Marcella's condition declined, so they called her daughter to see what she wanted them to do, as Marcella had no healthcare directive, but learned Veronica was also at the hospital, as her own breathing had worsened. Veronica begged the doctors to focus on saving her mother while Marcella said to focus on saving her daughter. Soon after, both of them were in the position to need ventilators, but only one was available. As Veronica had the better chance of survival, she was put on the ventilator while Marcella was bagged. Then Maggie had an idea to split the ventilator using a y-shaped tube, allowing both of them to use the same ventilator.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe is very close with her daughter.\n\n==Career==\nShe was a high school music teacher for 35 years.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 62 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diaz, Marcella}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
