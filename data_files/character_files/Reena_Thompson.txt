She was worried Zach could lose his kidney. Labs showed appendicitis, which they tried to treat with antibiotics, because surgery had a high likelihood of post-op infection due to his immunosuppressants. However, despite the antibiotics, his appendix burst and he was rushed into surgery.\n\nWhile Zach was in surgery, Alex went to update Reena. She was angry to learn that he'd made a mistake that led to Zach needing surgery, especially once she learned it could affect his kidney. She then asked Alex to leave.\n\nLater, when Zach was taken into surgery again, Zach asked Alex to sit with his mom, because she was worried. They sat together and waited.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer son, Zach, has a transplanted kidney. When he had abdominal pain, she was extremely worried he'd lose the kidney.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thompson, Reena}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
