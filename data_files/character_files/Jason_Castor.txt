Though the heart damage was repaired by [[Cristina Yang]], there was nothing they could do about the spinal cord damage and he was left paralyzed from the neck down. When his wife heard what had happened, she told Cristina that they needed to wake him up to ask him if he wanted to be kept on the ventilator or if he wanted to be allowed to die.

Though the heart damage was repaired by [[Cristina Yang]], there was nothing they could do about the spinal cord damage and he was left paralyzed from the neck down. When his wife heard what had happened, she told Cristina that they needed to wake him up to ask him if he wanted to be kept on the ventilator or if he wanted to be allowed to die.\n\nHe was awakened and informed about what had happened. After seeing his wife and her reaction, he decided to stay on the ventilator.\n\n====Trial Work====\nWhen the opportunity came up for Jason to be part of [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] trial to help paralysis patients like himself, but not him, he agreed to participate. While testing a special suit that allowed him to walk, his kidneys failed and he collapsed. Despite the fact that he was cleared to continue the trial, his wife believed he wouldn't because he believed she had talked him into doing it in the first place, just like he said that seeing her made him choose to live when he wanted to turn off the ventilator and die.\n\n===Relationships===\n====Romantic====\nHe is married to Elise Castor. After his accident, she became his caretaker.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x17-4.jpg\n10x17-5.jpg\n10x17-6.jpg\n10x17-8.jpg\n10x17-10.jpg\n10x17-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Castor, Jason}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
