He ended up in Iraq as a refugee, where he met [[Megan Hunt]], who raised him as her son for the next six years, though she was never able to adopt him legally. When she was evacuated to the US for medical treatment, he wasn't able to go with her because she couldn't get a visa for him. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n===Coming to Seattle===\nAfter seeing Megan's distress at not being able to be with Farouk, Nathan went to Iraq himself and had Farouk fake an illness so he could take Farouk to the US under the guise of participating in a medical trial. When he arrived, they tried to delay his entry while waiting on paperwork, but Meredith convinced them that his condition was critical enough not to wait, so he was taken to the hospital and happily reunited with his mom. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n===Moving to Los Angeles===\nAfter Megan was released from the hospital, she decided to move to the beach with Farouk and Nathan. She sent Nathan and Farouk ahead to set up the [[Megan and Nathan's House|house]]. While they worked, Farouk and Nathan bonded, agreeing that even though they didn't know what they were doing, they were prepared to muddle through together because they both love Megan. Megan later joined them and they went to the beach together and played happily. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n===Teddy and Owen's Wedding===\nMegan and Farouk came to Seattle for Teddy and Owen's wedding. The wedding was initially supposed to take place in a park, but before the priest could finish the ceremony, a couple on a tandem bicycle crashed into him, seriously injuring both him and the couple. After the priest died, Megan stepped in and performed the ceremony at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n===Illness===\nFarouk came to the hospital with his mother, who was concerned because he'd been getting short of breath more easily and his ankles were swollen. After an exam and some tests, Cormac diagnosed him with constrictive pericarditis and said he'd probably need surgery to correct it.
