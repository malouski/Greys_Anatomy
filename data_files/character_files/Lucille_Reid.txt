The work-up showed nothing, but when her friend, [[Julian]], mentioned that she'd been dizzy, Teddy ordered a CT Angio and a neuro consult. The test results showed stenosis and an aneurysm, so she had surgery for both problems at once. She was stable and awake after her surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Marvin]]. He's her third husband and hopes to be her last, saying he accepts what she has with Julian and knows she won't pick him over Julian.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe has been best friends with [[Julian]] for forty years. Because they valued their friendship so much, they never pursued romance, despite having strong feelings for each other.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 71 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reid, Lucille}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
