They ran a CT which revealed a brain abnormality, so they referred the family to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Derek ran an MRI and diagnosed Rasmussen's encephalitis. Half of Jamie's brain had died and needed to be removed to prevent the condition from spreading.\n\nIn her surgery, her anesthesiologist, who had been drinking, nodded off and Jamie started to wake up. They were able to rouse him and he put Jamie back out, but Derek told him to leave the OR after he was replaced by another anesthesiologist. Jamie's surgery was completed successfully.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was two years old at the time of her surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayes, Jamie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
