They thought it had cured her, but she was back in the hospital after she woke up barely breathing. Her boyfriend, [[Vincent]], brought her in and was shocked to learn that she had cancer as she hadn't told him.\n\nWhile drawing Marina's blood, George started shaking, though he thought it was due to something else. He handed her blood off and went to the clinic to lie down. However, when [[Olivia Jankovic|Olivia Harper]] and a lab tech ended up in the clinic as well, George figured out that Marina's blood was toxic due to a combination of her chemo drugs and an herbal supplement she was taking and called the OR. However, Marina had already been taken into the OR for a bowel resection. By the time he called, the OR staff had already collapsed from the effects of the neurotoxin.\n\nIn order to finish her surgery, they borrowed ortho suits. However, before they could finish getting ready, Marina started to wake up, so Addison had to go in to put her back under. Burke and Derek, then suited up, went in. They were able to complete the bowel resection, but didn't have time to close before they ran out of air. So the interns took turns going into the OR to pack her abdomen and do a temporary closure so she was stable for transport. She was then taken to ICU and given special dialysis to remove the toxin from her blood.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is dating [[Vincent]]. They live in the same building and he thought she was sexy when she folded clothes. They'd been dating for a few months and it got serious fast. When she woke up after surgery, she told him she'd hoped that all the bad stuff was behind her, which is why she didn't tell him.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wagner, Marina Rose}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ID)]]"}}}]}}}}
