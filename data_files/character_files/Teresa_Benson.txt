He was told it wasn't a big deal, but then he died. Teresa was left with a strong fear of medical procedures and equated surgery with death.\n\nWhen she grew up, she became pregnant. Her baby was diagnosed in utero with spina bifida. She had to overcome the fear to come to the hospital for the surgery. She made it to the hospital, but after they went to sedate her, she panicked and left, saying she'd try to come back.\n\nArizona went to her home and spoke to her about being a mother and doing what was best for her daughter.
