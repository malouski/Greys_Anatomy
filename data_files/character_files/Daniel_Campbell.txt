She was with him because it was his first time without the instructor\u00a0and he wanted her to be there. They were both airlifted to the ER, where Daniel had superficial facial lacerations and a piece of the plane lodged in his leg. The doctors were worried when he had no response to the injury to his leg, but he told them he'd been paralyzed for three years. Polly had much more serious injuries, including a laceration to her spleen, which the doctors decided just to watch. Daniel was taken to see Polly, but her spleen ruptured and she had to be rushed into surgery. After surgery, Daniel learned that Polly was paralyzed and Meredith told him she needed Daniel to tell her it's not the worst thing that could have happened.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe has been married to [[Polly Campbell]] for three years. They were engaged when he was in an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down. He gave her an out if she wanted to leave, but she decided to stay and brought the chaplain to his hospital room so they could marry immediately.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Campbell, Daniel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
