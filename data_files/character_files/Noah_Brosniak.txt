While Arizona was examining Liz, she noticed that Noah had an unnatural-sounding laugh. She asked Alex and Amelia to take a look at him. They took him for an MRI, which showed a brain tumor near his brain stem. Liz was then told that the tumor was inoperable, though Amelia and Alex believed the research they were doing for [[Kimmie Park]] might also work for Noah. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\nNoah later underwent the treatment and despite the difficulty, Noah woke up after his procedure and was awake and laughing normally at a video with his mother.
