On the day Theo was born, while she was in labor, she expressed regret for agreeing to have him and said it was a mistake. After he was born, she told Meredith she screwed up, but Meredith shushed her and when her son was brought over, she held him and talked to him.\n[[File:10x17BabyTheoHunt.png|thumb]]\nWhen Theo was a young toddler, he fell on concrete steps at a park and cut his head. Cristina brought him to the hospital, where Jo stitched up his head.
