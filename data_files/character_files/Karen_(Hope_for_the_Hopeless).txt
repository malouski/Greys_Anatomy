Her sister, Marcy, was a match and agreed to donate part of her liver to her sister. While they were hospitalized, Marcy pestered Karen by constantly talking about this wonderful thing she was doing for Karen and how she was missing her family vacation to do it.\n\nKaren told Marcy that she knew that Marcy would hold the liver donation over her head for the rest of their lives. They fought over it and Karen said that she didn't want Marcy's liver anymore. However, Karen began to cough up blood, a sign of end-stage liver failure. Karen agreed to accept Marcy's liver.\n\nAfter the surgery, Karen and Marcy started to fight again. Karen said that Marcy was never allowed to mention the liver again or she would reveal some of Marcy's secrets. When they continued to fight even after that, Meredith silenced both of them, saying they were in time out.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nKaren received a liver transplant from her sister, Marcy. While they were hospitalized, they bickered constantly. Marcy constantly reminded Karen of what a good thing she was doing for her, much to Karen's annoyance.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her liver transplant was [[Richard Webber|Richard's]] 10,000th surgery.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n8x12-6.png\n8x12-7.png\n8x12-11.jpg\n8x12-13.jpg\n8x12-14.jpg\n8x12-15.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Karen}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
