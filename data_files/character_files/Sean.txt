She was concerned because he was unresponsive during the entire exam, despite being conscious. After she left, Alex gave him $10. He said that Alex had promised 20 if he didn't ask about the fake leg. When he threatened to tell Arizona about the deal, Alex coughed up the other 10. Alex lied and told Arizona that he was a strange kid when she asked if he's always that quiet.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
