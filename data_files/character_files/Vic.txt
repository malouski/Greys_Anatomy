However, his plans were thwarted when she bit off the majority of his penis. He still took the opportunity to beat her severely.\n\n===Hospitalization===\nLong after the attack, Vic drove himself to the hospital, where he collapsed outside from the blood loss. He was taken inside the hospital, where they took him into surgery. They had the penis because Allison had swallowed it, but because it had been torn off by her teeth and partially digested in her stomach, they weren't able to reattach it. They were able to stop the bleeding and he was awake after surgery. While he was unconscious, he was arrested and handcuffed to his hospital bed.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]"}}}]}}}}
