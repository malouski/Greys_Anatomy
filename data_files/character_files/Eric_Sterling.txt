When they weren't home, he climbed in a window. The police came and, wrongly believing he was breaking into the house, shot him as he went to call his mom. He was taken to the hospital, where a CT Angio showed the vessel was intact, so they kept him for monitoring and antibiotics. Later, the vessel, weakened by the shot, ruptured and caused him to bleed heavily. He was taken into surgery, but they were unable to repair the damage and Eric died in the OR.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nEric's parents were devastated when he was shot climbing into their home.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 12 years old at the time of his death.\n*His age was the same as Tamir Rice was at the time of his death and he was named after Eric Garner and Alton Sterling.
