The dog growled to let her know that he didn't like it. However, since Jill is deaf, she didn't hear that and he bit her when she continued to pull. She was taken to the GSM ER where Jackson Avery said the wound wasn't deep and he could just stitch it up.\n\nWhile he was cleaning the wound, Jackson also wondered if her parents had looked into getting Jill a cochlear implant. They said they weren't interested.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She and her mother are both deaf. They use ASL to communicate.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kasliner, Jill}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]"}}}]}}}}
