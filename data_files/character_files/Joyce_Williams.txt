When Joyce woke up in the morning, she discovered that Jada and Shanice were both missing. She traded Jada's phone down by the water, but then the signal went dead, making her think whoever had taken her had thrown her phone in the water. She then tracked Jada's fitness watch, which led to a house at 10th Avenue and Newland. She knocked on the door, but [[Robert Corson|Bob Corson]] slammed the door in her face. So she yelled for help and drew the attention of Dean, Travis, and Vic, who were at [[Maya and Carina's Apartment|Maya's place]] for a post-fire celebration. She explained to them what had happened and asked for help getting her daughter out of the house. She had called the police, but they never came to her house like they said they would. She went to the station, where she filed a report, but they told her it could take days to get a warrant, so she came to the house herself. Three Black girls had disappeared from her neighborhood in the last year and the police had done nothing. She'd been unable to reach [[Sharon (Season 4)|Sharon]], Shanice's mom, so Vic suggested calling her again and then contacting all the girls' friends to check social media. Joyce started making calls to all their friends, but no one had seen them. Frustrated, Dean decided to go to the door and knock. Bob again denied having the girls in his house. Dean wanted to pretend he smelled a gas leak to get access to the house, but Maya stopped him and called the police herself.\n\nPolice arrived soon afterward, but they said they were there not in response to Joyce and Maya's calls, but because Bob had reported trespassers. They refused to help Joyce find her daughter, so Dean again said he smelled gas and the other firefighters agreed they smelled it as well. They knocked on the door, but Bob denied them access to check it out. But a few minutes later, they heard glass breaking and saw that a fire had burst out a basement window. Bob came out of the house coughing. Sullivan and Dean then went into the house in search of the girls. They found them and brought them out, but Bob claimed the girls were lying and had broken into his house. When Shanice admitted that they'd started the fire to lure rescue, the cops accused Shanice and Jada of lying. When Joyce heard this, she lunged at [[Officer Schneider]], but Maya held her back. Despite this, Schneider arrested her. In the ensuing chaos, Dean and Sullivan were also arrested unjustly. The three were then loaded into cop cars and driven away while Jada and Shanice were taken to the hospital. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\nHer daughter's doctor, [[Jackson Avery]], posted bail for Joyce upon hearing the full story. He had her brought to Jada's room at Grey Sloan, where they were reunited. ''(\"[[No Time for Despair]]\")''\n\nDean sued the police department in response to what happened to him and to Joyce. When they offered a settlement, Joyce said she wanted to take it and Dean decided to agree to the settlement, knowing it would help Joyce more than continuing the lawsuit. ''(\"[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married. Her husband was said to be in Nevada to see his mother, who had been refusing to wear her mask in public.\n\n===Familial===\nWhen her daughter disappeared in the middle of the night, she tracked her and helped aid in her safe recovery.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nS194x05JoyceWilliams.png|[[Out of Control]]\n17x06JoyceWilliams.png|[[No Time for Despair]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS194x05-1.jpg\nS194x05-5.jpg\nS194x05-7.jpg\nS194x05-8.jpg\nS194x05-9.jpg\nS194x05-10.jpg\nS194x05-13.jpg\nS194x05-14.jpg\nS194x05-15.jpg\nS194x05-16.jpg\nS194x05-17.jpg\n17x06-5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Joyce Williams Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Joyce}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
