Dr. Pierce examined him and ruled out a heart attack and aortic dissection, so she handed his case off to Dr. Bailey, who began to run tests to find out the cause. Jeremy was in a rush to get out of the hospital as quickly as possible so he could get back to work, so he agreed to skip a less invasive test and go straight to esophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, the EGD revealed a large tumor, which the doctors determined to be adenocarcinoma. His diet caused severe acid reflux, which made his esophagus the perfect breeding ground for cancer. They planned an esophagectomy, which involved removing part of his esophagus along with the tumor and replacing it with part of his colon. However, shortly after they started his surgery, he coded and was unable to be resuscitated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nJeremy is married to [[Ellen Weaver]]. Together, they have a daughter, [[Erin Weaver]].\n\n===Familial===\nJeremy has a daughter, Erin. While he was in the hospital waiting for tests, he asked the doctors to get him out of there quickly as he needed to go pick her up. When he found out that he had cancer, he asked his wife to tell Erin, but not in a way that would scare her.\n\n==Career==\nIt is unknown exactly what Jeremy does, but he was concerned about missing meetings with his clients, as he says he has a lot of balls in the air.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 42 at the time of his death.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weaver, Jeremy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
