When he was in high school, he and [[David (Station 19)|David]]\u00a0dressed as Dammit Janet and Dr. Frank N. Furter and went trick-or-treating. While walking, they heard a scream and saw a woman pressed against a window. Travis told David to call the cops, then shouldered his way through the door and tackled [[Chuck (Station 19)|Chuck]], who was beating his wife. That gave him a taste of being a hero and led to him becoming a firefighter.\n\n===Wedding===\nIn 2012, he got married to Michael. When they told Travis's family they were getting married, his mom was happy but his dad wasn't. Travis asked his mom to read a poem she had written during her pregnancy with him at his wedding. Travis's dad was ashamed and asked him why he had to be so open about it. At their wedding, Travis's mom and dad didn't show up but he and Michael still got married. Afterwards, his mom read them the poem at home but Travis said it wasn't enough. In 2016, Michael died leaving Travis to be a widower.\n\n===Leadership Changes at Station 19 and Dating Grant===\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station 19 responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], 1x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], 1x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], 1x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station 19 responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], 1x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], 1x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], 1x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya went with Travis on a medical call. They tended to [[Edith]], who had fallen and dislocated her shoulder, something that had happened before. Maya was shocked that Edith refused pain medication. Travis saw her foot shaking and asked if she had seen a doctor for it, but she said she was fine. Travis told her she needed an adjustable bed and her grandson was supposed to get her one. She said that she hadn't told her grandson about it because she didn't want him to worry. Travis later went back to check on her and her grandson was there, so he talked to the two of them together about her seeing a doctor.<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop. They later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter a small e-cigarette fire, the team was later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S19)|Shock to the System]], 1x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital. At the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she was scared of fire. They decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], 1x06 (S19)</ref>\n\nTravis and Maya used torches to drill Vic, but she stopped the drills and said they weren't helping.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], 1x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station 19 was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], 1x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], 1x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station 23 arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], 1x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nTravis was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station 19. Ripley started to ask him about how he was dealing with his husband's death and how he was adjusting to being at station 19, but Travis said he'd rather talk about the Captain decision, the reason they were there. He said that he thought he knew who he'd pick, but after that call, he knew Andy had made the right call when Jack wouldn't have. He told Ripley that Andy thinks like a Captain.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], 1x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. Outside the garage, they had trouble getting access to the house as the windows wouldn't shatter. They broke several chain saws trying to get through. With no ability to vent the fire, it continued to spread. Vic called Pruitt, who had experience getting people out of a garage. When he learned Andy was trapped along with others, he came down to the scene. Since the windows of the house wouldn't shatter, they used sledgehammers to break the wall underneath and vent the fire. It still wasn't enough to cool down the garage, so to give the trapped people more time, Travis had all hoses redirected to spray the garage, hoping to cool it down even a small amount. The trapped were freed when they used the water heater to cause an explosion and compromise the door just enough to give them access.<ref>[[Hot Box]], 1x09 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Skyscraper Fire and New Captain===\nStation 19 anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station 7 working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. Ben and Travis treated patients with minor burns at triage and sent them out. When Jack and Dean found combustibles on a floor above the fire, a rapid evacuation was started. In order to release the civilians from the top floor, Ripley sent Ben and Travis to clear the black smoke out of the stairwells so they could walk down. They did so, but when the fire jumped floors and broke out the windows, a flying shard of glass became impaled in Travis' chest. With the radios not working, Ben attempted to drag Travis down the stairs. On the stairs, they ran into Molly, who had been trampled by a panicked mob, leaving her gravely injured. Seemingly reconciling himself to fate, Travis urged Ben to leave him and get Molly to safety, which he reluctantly did. Travis was later found by Vic who was on her way to find someone to help Maya and Andy save Jack. She started pulling him down the stairs, where she met up with Dean, who was going to go after Jack, but Vic convinced him to stay with her and help her get Travis out. They were able to get Travis down the stairs and into an ambulance. By that point, Travis had lost so much blood that his heart stopped twice before they reached the hospital. Travis was taken into surgery, where it was discovered the glass had penetrated his heart. Initially, Vic was furious with Ben for leaving Travis, but she changed her tone after she learned Molly had died in surgery. Though the repair was difficult, Travis survived his surgery and spent the next several weeks with Grant, who helped take care of him as he recovered.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Travis came despite being on leave because he didn't want to miss the moment. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 19's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Travis helped Ben, who had been left behind at the station as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station 23 had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], 2x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], 2x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], 2x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nSullivan had suggested a peer group for firefighters to Travis and Vic to work out their conflict. They weren't going to go, but ultimately chose to. They were surprised to hear [[Lucas Ripley|Fire Chief Ripley]] talk about the skyscraper fire and the trauma he still experienced in the aftermath.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], 2x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station 19 held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Travis was paired with Dean, who didn't want to talk to him about his birthday. Upon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nTravis, Dean, and Ben responded to the call when [[Hannah Sherwood]] got her hand caught in her garbage disposal. She'd reached down there when her wedding ring had fallen in and got her hand caught. She turned it off quickly, but then decided to wait for help instead of trying to pull her hand out. Travis said he'd disconnect it and then take it apart to release her hand. While they were work, Hannah noticed that her daughter had gotten a tattoo and asked one of them to check it out to see if it was infected. Dean did and put antibiotic ointment on it. Travis was finally able to free Hannah's hand and they told her to follow up with the hospital in a few days.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], 2x06 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Friendsgiving, Windstorm and Breaking Up with Grant===\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station 23.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], 2x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him. Travis tried, but Jack left and wouldn't answer his phone.\n\nFour months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor, where Travis was disappointed not to see any hot strangers.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], 2x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter breaking up with Grant, Travis tried a revolving door of hobbies. Vic tried to support him through this, but didn't really understand the appeal. Vic also decided to tell Travis about her relationship with Ripley. He was shocked to learn she'd been hooking up with the Chief.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], 2x09 (S19)</ref>\n\nBen, Dean, and Travis had planned to work together to repaint Travis's place. As they prepared to leave, Sullivan talked his way into an invitation to join them. With Sullivan there, they painted in virtual silence. When Sullivan started dancing while painting, they were disturbed, but he explained that when a month ago, you couldn't move your legs, you dance when a song comes on that makes you want to dance. The rest of them started to dance as well.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], 2x10 (S19)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station 19. Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop. To prevent further damage to the building, Travis disconnected the fuel in the vehicle. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. After she was sent to the hospital, a broken cell phone and a secret extra propane tank caused an explosion, so they had additional difficulty stabilizing the building so it wouldn't collapse.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], 2x11 (S19)</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nAs an openly gay firefighter, Travis is often hailed for being braver than most, to which he responds in modest tone. \n\nTravis is the heart of the station. He keeps his everyone on track and helps his team members grow. Following the death of his firefighter husband Michael under an unexperienced Captain, Travis became stickler for following the rules and he makes sure that the newbies stay in line.\n\nHe considers himself an open book aside from a few details that he likes to keep to himself, such as his birthmarks.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Michael Cooper Williams|Michael Williams]] ====\n[[File:S192x10TravisMichael.png|thumb|A photograph of the married couple.]]\nTravis was married to a man named Michael Williams until Michael died on duty. He was a firefighter, too. He describes his late husband as his one true love. He told Andy he lost his husband to a captain who was too green, which made him worry about her being up for the job, because her lack of experience compared to Jack.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], 1x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter his husband's death, he ordered food and had grief sex with the delivery guy to combat the loneliness.\n\n====[[Grant (Station 19)|Grant]]====\nTravis met Grant at his grandmother's retirement community.<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nThey met again when Travis took Vic to a meditation class at the same place Grant teaches yoga. Grant gave Travis his number, but Travis didn't call. They met up again when Edith called Grant to her and called emergency services in an attempt to set the two of them up. They agreed to get breakfast, but when Grant showed up at the station the next morning, Travis admitted to Grant that while he was attracted to him, he doesn't date because he didn't want anyone to go through being widowed like he had. Grant laid out what he had planned for their first three dates and convinced Travis to agree to get breakfast for real.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], 1x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nGrant made Travis eggs in a jar for breakfast, which Travis agreed was the best thing he ever tasted. While they ate, Travis advised Grant that he needed to go very slowly, to ease back into dating. Grant promised he was okay with that, that he knows when it's worth the wait. Despite Travis's words, he later went to Grant after a long day at work and kissed him.<ref>[[Hot Box]], 1x09 (S19)</ref>\n\nGrant came to the hospital when Travis was injured in the fire, but couldn't get information from the desk because he wasn't family. But he found Ben and Vic, who updated him. He was worried that Travis had lied to him about always working in pairs when he learned that Travis had been left alone. When he learned that Ben had been with him and then left him to die, he was upset. He stayed at the hospital to see how Travis came out and when Travis survived his surgery, Grant helped take care of him as he recovered, keeping a strict eye on him.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref> Grant was unhappy when Travis decided he wanted to go back to work instead of taking the additional time off Grant wanted. He said he was worried he'd lose Travis, but Travis reassured him.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], 2x02 (S19)</ref> Due to Travis' injury, Travis said they skipped the early romance, including having sex for the first time. To combat this, Travis wore part of his uniform and seduced Grant.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nDuring Friendsgiving, things became awkward when Greg assumed they were married after seeing Travis's ring and Grant denied it quickly and emphatically. This worried Travis, who asked Grant about it at the end of the day. Grant revealed that he didn't want to get married.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], 2x07 (S19)</ref> After the windstorm was over, Travis and Grant talked and decided to end things because they had different visions of the future.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], 2x08 (S19)</ref>\n\n====[[Emmett Dixon]]====\nTravis and Emmett met and hooked up. The next morning, Travis was surprised when a naked Emmett joined him in the shower, thinking he would have left already. Afterward, Travis left for work and was shocked to see that Emmett was the new probie of the station and also [[Michael Dixon|Fire Chief Dixon's]] son. After a call, Travis briefly spoke to Emmett and brought up that Emmett hadn't told him he was a firefighter. Emmett simply replied Travis hadn't asked.\n\n===Familial===\nIn 2012, Travis got engaged to Michael. When they told Travis's parents, they were silent on the issue and then his father left the table. As they planned the wedding, Travis asked his mother to read a poem she'd written while she was pregnant with Travis at the ceremony. She agreed, but on the day of the wedding, neither of his parents came. Michael promised to be his family and show up for him.\n\nAfter the wedding, Nari read the poem to them privately. Michael said she'd done her best, though Travis said it wasn't enough.\n\nHe was once caught skipping Sunday School, and his father gave him the silent treatment for a year.<ref>[[House Where Nobody Lives]], 3x04 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Friendships===\n====[[Victoria Hughes]]====\nTwo weeks after his husband died, Travis was working at Station 19, where he met Victoria Hughes. They had a rocky start because she disliked him second guessing her, but Vic helped him through his grief and they bonded as Travis pushed Vic to train harder and do better.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nUpon his return to work, Travis noticed some tension between himself and Vic. He asked her about it, but she denied anything was wrong. This later built up to a fight when she revealed that she was upset that he'd quit on life in the skyscraper. Sullivan told them to stop fighting at the station and suggested a peer support group where they could go.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], 2x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nTravis and Vic mended their relationship\u00a0at the support group and it was further strengthened by the fact that she later told him about her secret relationship with Chief Lucas Ripley. In Travis' own words he felt that they'd \"really come full circle\" and that he was glad to have his best friend back.\u00a0\n\nLater, he confided in her that he was still really hung up on Michael and she said that sounded pretty normal considering how awesome Michael was.\u00a0\n\nThroughout their relationship, Vic talked to Travis about Lucas and when Lucas suggested getting married for practical reasons, Travis talked her out of saying yes, because he said something real was more important than something practical.\u00a0\n\nWhen Lucas was in hospital and Vic had to say her final goodbyes, Travis held her hand and helped her through it. He was devastated that his best friend had to go through what he went through with Michael.\n\nOn the day of the funeral, Travis and Vic fell out as he thought she should attend because she needed to accept what had happened no matter how awful it was, but she didn't want to. She commented that Travis was still in denial over Michael. However, during Sullivan's speech about his best friend, the two shared a quick\u00a0heartfelt glance and appear to make up. That evening, Travis defended Vic by beating up another firefighter who said nasty things about her and Ripley's relationship at a bar.\n\nVic noticed Travis wasn't at the station and worried a little about him, but Sullivan brushed her off. Pruitt bailed Travis out of jail and went with him and Ryan Tanner to LA, where the rest of the team were fighting a wildfire.\n\nTravis helped Vic get into her bed for the first time since Lucas' death and he even managed to make her laugh.<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], 2x17 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Professional===\nTravis is close with all the firefighters at the station and he works well with everyone.\u00a0\n\n==Career==\nTravis is a firefighter at [[SFD Station 19|Station 19]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]].
