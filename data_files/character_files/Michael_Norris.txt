He was entered into the donor list 17 seconds before Denny Duquette. When two donor hearts became available at Mercy West Medical Center, Erica Hahn went to retrieve Michael's and Preston Burke to retrieve Denny's. After Denny's donor died, Burke fought over Michael's donor's heart. After calling UNOS, they confirmed that Michael was higher on the list than Denny by a very small margin, but being entered into the list 17 seconds earlier gave him the edge. After Izzie found this out, she lied and said that Denny was getting worse, hoping to move his status up so he'd get the heart. When they asked her to confirm with tests, she cut Denny's LVAD wire to worsen his condition so she could get tests results that said he was in worse condition. The heart ultimately went to Denny, causing Michael to go back on the transplant list.

His first procedure failed and he almost went home, but Izzie talked him back into doing a second procedure, which was a success. Hahn said she bought him some time, but he still needed a new heart.

They have two kids together.\n\n===Familial===\nHe has two children with his wife.\n\n===Professional===\nErica said that she doesn't get close to patients, but she really liked Michael.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 44 at the time of his alcohol ablation.\n*He's the last patient to be treated on-screen by\u00a0[[Erica Hahn|Dr. Erica Hahn]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n5x07-11.jpg\n5x07-19.jpg\n5x07-28.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Norris, Michael}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
