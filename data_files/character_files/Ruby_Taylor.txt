Ruby was then born at 37 weeks after her mom had a quick and early labor. She was taken to the NICU after birth, where a heart workup showed no troubles. Her father was able to hold her after her mother died of complications of her birth. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n===Failure to Thrive===\nMatthew brought Ruby back to the hospital when she had trouble eating and was vomiting. Arizona examined her and suspected it had something to do with her heart, but before she could run more tests, Matthew admitted that he was uncomfortable with her as Ruby's doctor, so she handed Ruby off to Owen. Owen examined her, but April went to him with a suspicion that it wasn't her heart and was actually something intestinal instead. Ruby was diagnosed with pyloric stenosis, which was easily corrected with surgery. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother died the day she was born.
