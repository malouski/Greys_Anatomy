He was primarily worried about his wife and told the doctors to do whatever they needed with their baby. They'd only just adopted her and Sean didn't feel like he had bonded with her very well. She hadn't even been named yet because they wanted to get to know her first.\n\nWhen it started to look like his wife wouldn't make it, he wanted to know who to call because he didn't think he could raise the baby on his own. While Teresa was having surgery, Meredith came out to give him an update and said that some people bond instantly and others take a while to feel like a family. He might know his daughter more than he thinks. He listed off all the things he knows about her. Meredith says that's five things he knows that no one else does.\n\nWhen the doctors informed him that Teresa had died, he decided to keep the baby. He named her Keisha because that's what Teresa wanted to name her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to [[Teresa Brotherton]] until her death.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and Teresa adopted a baby girl.
