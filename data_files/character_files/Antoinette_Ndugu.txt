The call was going nicely until Ante's son, Clifford, joined the call. After a brief disagreement, Winston abruptly left the call, not wanting to speak to his father. This left Maggie to speak to them awkwardly. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\nWhen Maggie and Winston got engaged, Maggie called Antoinette to come to Seattle for the wedding, surprising Winston. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding, Bill and Antoinette objected. They said they'd been waiting for this for their kids' entire lives and wanted them to do it right. They said they should wait and get married when things started opening up again. Maggie and Winston easily agreed and postponed the wedding. In April 2021, a new wedding took place on the beach with a much larger guest list.
