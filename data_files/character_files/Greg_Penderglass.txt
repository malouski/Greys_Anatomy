A mass was revealed. A CT showed that the mass was a fetus in fetu, a twin that Greg enveloped in the womb.\n\nThat fetus was determined to be the cause of Greg\u2019s pain, so they scheduled surgery to remove it. However, Greg refused consent for the surgery, saying it was rare and special, so he wanted to keep it. Richard convinced him to let them remove it, but offered to let him keep it afterward.\n\nUpon seeing the removed fetus in the tub, Greg screamed and begged them to take it away.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Jodi Penderglass]]====\nHe has been married to Jodi Penderglass for ten years.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a junk collector who sells things at flea markets.
