Jake was taken into surgery to repair a perforated stomach and a bowel obstruction. After his surgery, the cause of the damage was still a mystery. When Jake was told that, he pointed out the rash on Marion's wrist, which she was scratching. [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] examined Marion's arm and saw that there was a worm under her skin. She believed Jake had the same worm in his body. They contracted the worm when they ate sushi from a train station while in Thailand.\n\nThey planned to extract Marion's worm from her arm, but they didn't know where Jake's was, so he was put on anti-parasitics to kill it. However, his legs then went numb and he was unable to move them, indicating that the worm was in his spine. Scans showed that the worm had eaten through his vertebrae, so he was immediately taken into surgery, where the worm was removed from his C-4 vertebrae.\n\nWhile Jake was in surgery, Marion's worm was removed from her arm.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Jake Steiner]]. They had been married and divorced twice before. For their first honeymoon, they went to Kauai. For the second, they went to Fiji. For their third, they went to Thailand, which is where they both contracted a parasite.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She and Jake had been on 3 honeymoons in the previous 12 years.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Steiner, Marion}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
