She was also 35 weeks pregnant. She was taken into the ER, where an ultrasound determined that the baby was fine, though she was having contraction. Mark examined the arm and said the wound was clean, so he thought he could re-attach the arm if they could find it. Nancy pleaded with them to find her arm because her baby had no father and she needed two arms. She had just moved to [[Seattle]], so she had no one around to help her. She was sick of waiting for the right guy, which is why she decided to have a baby on her own.\n\nBefore her surgery, she freaked out, saying she was scared. Meredith talked to her, saying she was brave and it was better to be alone and feel successful than being with someone and feeling like a failure all the time.\n\nDuring her surgery, she went into labor. [[George O'Malley]] had to deliver her baby so Mark could finish the re-attachment.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe says in her family, having a baby without a father is not something you do.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 34 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walters, Nancy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
