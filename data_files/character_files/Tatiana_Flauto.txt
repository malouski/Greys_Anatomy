A bystander gave her a towel with ice on it, which adhered to the burns, so they had to use saline to remove the towel. She was worried, so Jackson said that the two of them were a team, so they'd be together through the whole process.\n\nA few months after that, she had facial reanimation surgery.\n\nWhen April and Jackson got married, she looked at their wedding album while at the hospital after yet another surgery and said that April was a beautiful bride and that she wanted the chance to be a beautiful bride someday.\n\nA year and a half into her treatment, she became discouraged and wanted to quit. However, Jackson was able to convince her to continue.\n\nDuring her treatment, she had two paramedian forehead flaps become necrotic.\n\nAfter her final surgery, a nasal septum reconstruction, she was finally pleased with the result.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe married a man named Timothy. They had a fight the morning of their wedding, but Jackson said they'd probably have the same fights for 50 years and not to let a little thing become a big thing. Jackson then walked her down the aisle at her wedding.\n\n===Professional===\nWhile Jackson was her doctor, the two grew close, to the point where after all her surgeries were completed, he walked her down the aisle at her wedding. She knew about him losing his son and his marital troubles. She said that he kept every promise he made to her.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She had 43 surgeries over a span of four years, three months, one week, and four days.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n12x11-2.jpg\n12x11-15.jpg\n12x11-16.jpg\n12x11-17.jpg\n12x11-18.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flauto, Tatiana}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]"}}}]}}}}
