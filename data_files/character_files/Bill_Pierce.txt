Richard sent a helicopter for him and met him on the roof. Although Bill wanted to reimburse the hospital for the expense of the helicopter ride, Richard refused to accept, stating that bringing Bill to the hospital was family business. Richard then led Bill to Diane's room, where Maggie was hugging her mother's body while Amelia and Meredith sat with her. When she saw him, Maggie got up and hugged her father. ''(\"[[Be Still, My Soul]]\")''\n\n===Maggie's Wedding===\nBill returned to Seattle when Maggie called him to come for her wedding. She had realized that her wedding would never be perfect because her mother wouldn't be there, so she invited her father and Winston's grandmother to come to Seattle for a small wedding. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nOn the day of Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding, Bill and Antoinette objected. They said they'd been waiting for this for their kids' entire lives and wanted them to do it right. They said they should wait and get married when things started opening up again. Maggie and Winston easily agreed and postponed the wedding. In April 2021, a new wedding took place on the beach with a much larger guest list. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Hip Surgery===\nMaggie went to visit her father when he had surgery on his hip. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to [[Diane Pierce]]. During their marriage, she had a long-term affair with the man who fixed their car. They eventually split up over it.\n\nFor their twentieth anniversary, he took dance lessons.
