''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\n===Prom===\nAt her prom, Camille lost consciousness during sex. She was taken to the ER, where Addison examined her and said her pelvic exam was concerning. Addison did an ultrasound and asked about symptoms. Camille revealed that she'd been having pain, but she didn't tell anyone because she wanted to go to prom and she didn't want to be the girl with cancer again. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\n===Hospital Prom===\nWanting to make up for her missing her prom, Richard had the interns throw a prom in the hospital. He made attendance mandatory for all the staff. At the prom, Camille danced with Brian and her uncle. ''(\"[[Losing My Religion]]\")''\n\n===Decision to Die===\nCamille came into the ER not breathing. [[Jeremy Bennett]] couldn't intubate, so they did a cricothyrotomy to get her breathing. Then they did an endoscopy and removed the mass that was blocking her throat, but they needed to do labs to see where the other mets were. The cancer had spread to her chest, lungs, and throat. Her family thought she'd beat the cancer a third time, but Camille said that she was tired of fighting and just wanted to go home. Adele and Arlene convinced Richard to talk Camille into having more treatment, but after he spoke with her, he said that as an uncle, he wanted her to do it, but as a doctor, he'd honor her wishes. She said again that she wanted to go home. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nCamille lost her virginity on the night of her high school prom to her boyfriend [[Brian (Season Two)|Brian]]. Unfortunately, she passed out and was admitted to [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]], where it was revealed her cancer had returned. ''(\"[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\")''\n\n===Friendships===\n[[Natalie]] and [[Claire (Season 2)|Claire]] are two of her best friends.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n226CamilleTravis.png|[[Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response]]\n227CamilleTravis.png|[[Losing My Religion]]\n404CamilleTravis.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x26-13.jpg\n2x27-11.jpg\n2x27-46.jpg\n4x04-2.jpg\n4x04-10.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Camille Travis Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Camille Travis]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Travis, Camille}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
