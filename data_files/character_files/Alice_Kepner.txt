They all agreed that Matthew was a dreamboat, but when Jackson came in, they started fawning over for him, questioning if he was, \"''the'' Jackson.\" April dodged their questions and asked Matthew to take her sisters back to her apartment while she answered a page from the hospital. Her sisters instead insisted that they wanted to go with her.\n\n===Hospital Tour===\nThe three of them went to the hospital with April, where she gave them a quick tour. On the tour, they met [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], whom Kimmie said was very brave because of her amputation. Jackson and Matthew then came in with a patient, on whom Matthew had performed an incorrect tracheotomy. April sent him away with her sisters.\n\n===April's Bridal Shower===\nAfter being sent away from the trauma, Kimmie, Libby, and Alice planned the rest of April's bridal shower. The next day, they brought the supplies to the hospital and were upset to learn that April was in surgery and might not make it to the shower. When she finally did show up at the party, April started opening gifts. One of the gifts was a thong, which April mistakenly opened in front of everyone. When they picked on her for her lack of experience, she confessed that she'd had sex before, which shocked them. She then fired them as her bridesmaids and hired Arizona, Meredith, and Cristina to replace them. ''(\"[[Man on the Moon]]\")''\n\n===April's Wedding===\nAlice and her sisters were angry that April \"fired\" them as her bridesmaids and chose\u00a0[[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]],\u00a0[[Meredith Grey|Meredith]],\u00a0and\u00a0[[Cristina Yang|Cristina]]\u00a0to be her bridesmaids instead. Despite their anger, they did attend the wedding, where they angrily looked at their sister's bridesmaids. When Jackson stood up to confess his love for April and ask her if she loved him too, Alice and her sisters were surprised by his confession and waited for April's answer.\u00a0''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nAs Alice has said she walked down the aisle a virgin, she got married at some point in her life. It can can be presumed that she and her husband are still together, as the Kepners are extremely religious and a divorce would most likely have been mentioned. On top of that, Alice seems to have a happy, normal life.\n\n===Familial===\nAlice has an extremely close bond with her sisters, Libby and Kimmie in particular. Since April moved away to\u00a0[[Seattle]], their relationship is not as close as it is with her other sisters.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Alice walked down the aisle a virgin, just as April intended to do before she slept with\u00a0[[Jackson Avery|Jackson]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x11AliceKepner.png|[[Man on the Moon]]\n10x12KimmieLibbyAliceKepner.png|[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x11-1.jpg\n10x11-2.jpg\n10x11-4.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Alice Kepner Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Alice Kepner]]\n[[fr:Alice Kepner]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kepner, Alice}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
