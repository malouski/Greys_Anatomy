During her pregnancy, two of the fetuses were diagnosed with TTTS. [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] did fetal surgery to separate the vessels. It was successful, but Courtney was put on bed rest with continuous fetal monitoring as she recovered. Ben did an ultrasound and was able to locate three of the fetuses easily, but Baby C, whom they were calling Charles, the only male, wasn't where he expected, so he paged Arizona. She located Charles, but noted that he had descended and Courtney was in labor. They moved her to the OR in case they had to deliver the babies and gave her medicine to try to stop her labor. Her labor didn't slow and Charles started having late decels. When Arizona examined Courtney, she said she'd have to deliver Charles because he was already partially born. Courtney begged her to do something, to save her babies, and Arizona decided to deliver Charles, then sterilize his cord and put it back inside, reducing the chance of infection and stopping labor to give the other three fetuses a chance to continue gestating.\n\nCharles was born and then Courtney's cervix was stitched closed. Charles was taken to the NICU, where he was oxygenating well despite his prematurity. Doug came to visit him and used a tablet with video chat so Courtney could see him as well.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Courtney Hall]].\n\n===Familial===\nHis wife was pregnant with quadruplets. One of the babies, [[Charles Hall|Charles]], had to be delivered at 23 weeks, but they were able to stop labor, giving the other three more time to grow and develop.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He bought a gift basket for the doctors.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hall, Doug}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
