When he was taken to the ER, he gave [[Alex Karev]] $50 in order to convince him to put him next to [[Mrs. Banks]], a woman who ate at the restaurant often. He had a broken ankle, which was reduced and casted.\n\nHe told Alex that she'd been coming to the restaurant for years, before she even met her future husband. He had fallen in love with her while watching her eat, even as she started bringing her future husband. Unbeknownst to him, Mrs. Banks was awake and listening the whole time he was talking.\n\nEmile later collapsed to the floor with an epidural bleed. They took him into surgery to repair the bleed, but despite their best efforts, he died in surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe fell in love with one of his restaurant customers, [[Mrs. Banks]]. He spent over 15 years watching her fall in love with her husband and marry him and never said anything. He believed that the Banks' marriage was loveless, but Mrs. Banks said it wasn't.\n\n==Career==\nHe'd been the head waiter at Grandinetti's for 25 years when the roof collapsed.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flores, Emile}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
