He conservatively estimated that he could get Derek 80% of his hand function back. However, Derek wasn't satisfied with this plan and when Callie proposed an alternate solution that would get him back to full function, he convinced her to try that instead and Dr. Schacter's plan was abandoned.\n\n==Career==\nDr. Schacter is an attending neurosurgeon at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. According to Callie, he's a great neurosurgeon, one of the best.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schacter, Dr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
