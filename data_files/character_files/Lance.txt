He said he had pulmonary hypertension and had forgotten to take his water pill that morning, meaning flying was uncomfortable for him. Meredith told him that wasn't an excuse to treat mothers like that. He returned to his seat and shortly after, the plane hit turbulence. When he saw Meredith treating patients, he asked if she knew if they would be landing on time, because he had a tight connection to make. She handed him a bag and told him to breathe into it and sit down.\n\nLater, he struggled to breathe due to his condition, so Nathan stepped in to help him. He got EDs from [[Janis (In the Air Tonight)|Janis]] and gave them to Lance, but then Lance went into cardiac arrest. Dave got the defibrillator and Nathan used it on Lance several times unsuccessfully, so he continued CPR. While the pilot was making an emergency landing, Nathan was finally able to restore sinus rhythm. Several ambulances met the plane to take the injured to the hospital.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*His bag had to be gate-checked.\n*He likes sitting on the aisle.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x20-3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
