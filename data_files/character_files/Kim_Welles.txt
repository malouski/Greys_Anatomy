She was experiencing severe stomach pain. Her friends believed she was just drunk or that she had been drugged. However, after they relayed the events of their day, [[April Kepner]] determined that one of the drinks she'd consumed, a smoking nipple, which contained liquid nitrogen, had caused an abdominal rupture. Kim was taken into surgery, where April performed a roux-en-y anastomosis to remove her stomach and attach her intestine directly to her esophagus.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nTwo of her friends, [[Brenda]] and [[Talia]] accompanied her to the hospital. However, they were drunk and when they were told about her injuries, they were more concerned with whether or not she'd be able to go out drinking with them again.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 21 at the time of her hospitalization.\n*She had lemon drops at O'Briens, Cosmos at Bar Nouveau, Tequila Shots at Kappa Sig, and Smoking Nipples during brunch.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Welles, Kim}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
