She was out on the balcony when it broke, sending her falling three floors to the ground. She was taken to the ER, where they determined she had a broken, windswept pelvis. They took her into the OR, where she had a splenectomy and her pelvis was externally fixated. After her surgery, she was put into a medically-induced coma. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\nGarrett waited by Natasha's bedside for weeks while she slept. After a month, they took her off the sedatives, and she woke up on Christmas Eve. On New Years Eve, she was off the ventilator and speaking. However, after that, she started to decline again. She was put on dialysis and back on the ventilator. After 85 days in the hospital, Natasha and Garrett decided to have the doctors turn the ventilator off. They then gave them the wedding they wanted, with phones displaying star pictures, in her hospital room, right before she died.
