Scans revealed that he had a brain tumor, because the growths had turned inward.\n\nWhile Derek planned the tumor resection, Mark proposed a plan to remove the growths from the outside of Jake's skull, giving him a more normal appearance. Derek was against the idea, but Jake wanted the surgery. After convincing his parents, they signed the consent so he could have the surgery. They planned to do both procedures under the same round of anesthesia to make things easier on Jake's body.\n\nJake died during the tumor resection, but Alex and Cristina had the idea that Mark could still fix his face for his parents. After he was done, Jake's parents came in to see his body and cried.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Mrs. Burton]]. Together, they have one son.\n\n===Familial===\nHis son, Jake, was born with a condition that caused tumors to grow all over his face. When he was 15, he had a brain tumor that required surgery. When he died during that surgery, she was devastated.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x18-3.JPG\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burton, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
