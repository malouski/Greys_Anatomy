Derek proposed dividing Greg's jaw, pallet, and tongue in order to access the tumor. Greg was warned about the extent of the surgery and that recovery would be painful.\n\nThe surgery commenced with Mark dividing the tongue, jaw, and pallet, assisted by Callie. Once this was done, Derek was able to reach the tumor and successfully remove it. Both Richard and Owen declared that they had never seen a surgery do so much damage. Owen even said that explosives in Iraq had done less damage.\n\nAfter waking up from the surgery, the pain overwhelmed Greg and his mother called Derek in a panic. Derek noted that the pain was a \"healing pain\" and was good in that it meant they had won the battle against the tumor. Greg appeared to take comfort from this revelation.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nGreg's mother came to the hospital with him. She opposed the surgery because it was dangerous, but eventually agreed.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n7x01-19.jpg\n7x01-31.jpg\n7x01-47.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bevell, Greg}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
