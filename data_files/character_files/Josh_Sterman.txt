He was at the hospital to have surgery in which cement would be injected into his spine to stabilize it. The surgery went well and he seemed fine afterward, but then he collapsed when he got up to walk with assistance. He was rushed back into surgery, where Maggie discovered that his pulmonary artery was destroyed because Nico had made a mistake during the first surgery. She tried to patch it, but the graft didn't hold. Despite her best efforts, he was pronounced dead in the OR.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe's very close with his grandfather, who was devastated when he died.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 21 at the time of his death.\n*He went to University of Washington.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sterman, Josh}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
