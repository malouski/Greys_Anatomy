She was assigned to visiting cardiothoracic attending [[Virginia Dixon]], with [[Miranda Bailey]] and [[Cristina Yang]] on her service.\n\nStacy's condition worsened and her\u00a0surgery\u00a0to\u00a0repair the defect was moved forward.\u00a0When she was on the table however, Dr. Dixon noticed that although she could repair the defect, the heart\u00a0had too much scar tissue and would not last, meaning that without a heart-lung transplant, Stacy would die. Upon hearing this, Bailey, who was first assisting, dropped tools and left the OR, causing Cristina\u00a0to step in.\n\nOnce out\u00a0of the\u00a0OR,\u00a0Stacy was put\u00a0on\u00a0IV medications, which she would need on a continuous basis\u00a0in order to stay alive until she could recieve a transplant, which could\u00a0take years. Stacy's parents were devastated at\u00a0this, given that it meant\u00a0she had to stay in a hospital bed until a donor could be found.\n\nWhile this was happening, Bailey had visited the hospital day care to spend time\u00a0with Tuck. Upon observing a\u00a0girl wearing a backpack, she had an idea. She ran into Stacy's room and excitedly anounced to Stacy's parents that Stacy could wear a\u00a0backpack containing a\u00a0mobile\u00a0pump which would deliver her medication and allow her to leave the hospital and live a\u00a0normal life. Stacy's parents were\u00a0delighted at hearing\u00a0this.\n\nLater on, Dixon, assisted by Bailey and Robbins, installed the portable device. After surgery, Stacy was seen with her backpack. When Bailey first showed the backpack and\u00a0pump to her parents, Stacy asked if she could have \"a prettier one.\" Bailey had used a 'bedazzler' to make the backpack look prettier to Stacy's delight.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nStacy's parents came to the hospital with her. When she said that she's the best player on her soccer team, her mother said it was bragging while her father said it was just the truth.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She plays soccer and thinks she is the best on the team.\n*She was 9 at the time of her surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pollock, Stacy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
