He did an ultrasound of Arizona's breasts and showed her on the monitor where there was a lesion. Panicked, they rushed back to Grey Sloan where a second ultrasound showed no lesion and no concern. He had faked the ultrasound image in her case as well as others and then subjected them to chemotherapy just to pocket the extra money. Owen went back to his office and got a bag of chemo drugs ready to injected into Scott, but stopped as police arrived and told Scott he had called them.\n\n==Career==\nHe's an [[Attending|attending]] [[Oncology|oncologist]]. He used his influence to give many patients false cancer diagnoses so he could make money off the chemotherapy they didn't need.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He had a five-star Yelp rating.\n*He's not a member of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hanson, Scott}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
