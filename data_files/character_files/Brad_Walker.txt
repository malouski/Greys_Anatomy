His father believed he was faking it to get out of school, but they ran tests to look for a cause. His scans were all clean, so they wanted to run an exploratory laparoscopy in order to diagnosed chronic mesenteric ischemia. [[Alex Karev]] convinced Brad's father to let them run the test, but it was negative. He became unstable during the surgery, meaning that even though he didn't have chronic mesenteric ischemia, there was definitely something wrong.\n\nThey had placed a central line in surgery, but it kinked, so they had to put in a chest tube. Brad started bleeding into the chest tube and his condition was so emergent that Alex had to open his chest in his ICU room in order to stop the bleeding. They then moved him to the OR for surgery. He had a ruptured aortic arch dissection, which they repaired in surgery. After surgery, his parents were told he was doing fine.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis parents, particularly his father, believed he was faking his abdominal pain in order to get out of school.\n\n[[fr:Brad Walker]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walker, Brad}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
