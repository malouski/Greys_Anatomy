She had a few too many drinks and when leaving the bar, she was attacked and raped.\n\nJo was walking through the lobby at the hospital when she ran into Abby, who had a cut on her cheek. She got lost looking for the ER. In the ER, when pressed, she revealed a bruised abdomen. An ultrasound showed that her diaphragm had been ruptured and her organs were pushed up into her chest. Before she could have surgery, Jo said she believed that Abby had been sexually assaulted and she wanted her to have the option to get justice if she felt differently. She agreed to let them collect a sexual assault evidence kit. Jo then told her that the kit would stay at the hospital if she decided she wanted to talk to the cops.\n\nWhen Abby was ready for her surgery, she started to panic because she said every man has his face. Jo had all the female employees of the hospital paged to line the hallway between her room and the elevator, to lend their support and make sure she didn't see any men's faces as she was wheeled to surgery.\n\nAbby's surgery went well and after she woke up, she was told she'd need a drain for a few days, but she'd be okay. They also suggested that she talk to someone, saying it didn't have to be her husband, but they felt it would help her. After talking with Jo about her own experience, Abby called her husband and the police to file a report.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to a man named Jack. Her husband was in Portland on a business trip when she went to the hospital.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x19-1.jpg\n15x19-2.jpg\n15x19-3.jpg\n15x19-4.jpg\n15x19-5.jpg\n15x19-6.jpg\n15x19-7.jpg\n15x19-27.jpg\n15x19-32.jpg\n15x19-33.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Redding, Abby}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
