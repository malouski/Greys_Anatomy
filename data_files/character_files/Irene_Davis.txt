A few days later, she went to the ER because the pain hadn't resolved. Jo suspected she had a kidney stone and ordered a CT to confirm. The CT showed a large kidney stone in her right ureter, so Jo called Catherine to consult on the case. Catherine said she'd need lithotripsy to break up the stone and remove it. The procedure went well, but when Catherine removed the scope, Irene's ureter came with it. Catherine converted to an exploratory laparotomy to try to re-attach the ureter to her kidney, but found it was too short, so she had to remove the kidney and re-attach it elsewhere. After the surgery, Irene was told she was stable and was producing urine. She was told she could go home in three days if her pain was under control.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer sister, [[Abigail Hayes|Abigail]], died after a medical device caused cancer to spread throughout her body. After this, she stepped up and became a large part in her nephews' lives. Her sister's death made her distrustful of western medicine, causing her to seek alternative treatments for her ailments.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 35 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x10-1.jpg\n17x10-2.jpg\n17x10-13.jpg\n17x10-14.jpg\n17x10-16.jpg\n17x10-24.jpg\n17x10-26.jpg\n17x10-27.jpg\n17x10-28.jpg\n17x10-29.jpg\n17x10-30.jpg\n17x10-31.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Irene}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
