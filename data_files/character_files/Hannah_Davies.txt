She was unable to stop the bleeding with gauze, so she put her hand in the wound, which stopped the bleeding. When they got to the hospital, they discovered that her hand was possibly holding the ammunition in place and so told her not to remove her hand. As they worked with the bomb squad to form a plan, she was left alone with [[Dr. Milton]], who went on to tell her about [[Pink Mist|pink mist]] and then left her alone to manually respirate the patient while she kept her hand steady. She was visibly upset after he left and when [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] and [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] found her, she was contemplating removing her hand. She did ultimately remove it, but Meredith quickly replaced Hannah's hand with her own.

After the bomb exploded, Burke told [[Mindy Carlson]] that Hannah had saved her husband's life. Mindy hugged her and thanked her.
