After completing medical school, he was matched to Grey Sloan Memorial. On his first day, Koracick assigned him to scut despite his experience practicing medicine.\n\nHe was later tested for COVID, along with the rest of the hospital staff. At the end of the day, Reza, along with Sara and Alma Ortiz, was taken into the OR by Richard Webber, who modified his traditional intern speech to fit the pandemic, promising them to teach them as much as they could and assuring them they'd get through it together. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nWhile assisting Jo while she operated on [[Val Ashton]], Reza used his surgical skill to anticipate her moves. He explained how he came to the US to escape religious persecution and bombings and felt having to repeat his training was a small price to pay. He cheerfully followed Jo's orders, explaining to her that his mother taught him that every day above ground was a good day. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nHe continued working with Jo on Val's case as Val's condition worsened. Finally, two days after Val's surgery, she had to go on liver dialysis when her remaining liver began failing. Later, she coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n===Andrew's Death===\nWhen Levi found himself unable to work on Andrew's surgery for fear of being too distracted to be a good doctor, he asked Reza to step in for him. Reza assisted Teddy as she worked on Andrew's heart. They were able to repair the damage and Andrew was stable and awake in the ICU afterward. However, Andrew coded again later that night and had to be taken back into surgery. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to save Andrew and Reza called time of death. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n===Arthur Beaton===\nReza worked on the case of [[Arthur Beaton]], a toddler who was born with multiple ventricular septal defects. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n===Gerlie Bernardo===\nWhen Meredith took over the residency program at the hospital, she cancelled grand rounds in favor of having the residents shadow her on Gerlie's case, as she suffered through multiple post-COVID complications.\n\nIn January, Reza was able to get his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine along with the rest of the hospital staff. Meredith also had the residents still working on Gerlie's case, specifically trying to get Bailey to put Gerlie on the list for a double lung transplant. Finally, Bailey agreed and in April 2021, Gerlie got her lungs. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===The Webber Method===\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total, 13 patients were treated using this method. Reza assisted Levi with two of them, as Levi finished the first one earlier than anticipated and another patient had come in through the ER. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe learned a sense of optimism from his mother, who said that every day above ground is a good day. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. He was a [[Vascular Surgery|vascular surgeon]] back in Pakistan, but the US forced him to repeat all his training.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n17x03RezaKhan.png|[[My Happy Ending]]\n17x05RezaKhan.png|[[Fight the Power]]\n17x07RezaKhan.png|[[Helplessly Hoping]]\n17x11RezaKhan.png|[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\n17x17RezaKhan.png|[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\n18x04RezaKhan.png|[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x03-6.jpg\n17x11-17.jpg\n18x04-1.jpg\n18x04-2.jpg\n18x04-3.jpg\n18x04-5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Reza Khan Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khan, Reza}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
