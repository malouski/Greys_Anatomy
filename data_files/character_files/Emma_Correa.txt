Desperate not to become that couple who just grows to hate each other, Emma bought a tandem bike and signed them up for the Undies bike race. They were racing when Emma saw an anti-oil activist with something interesting written on her body, but when she tried to read it, she steered them off the path and into Teddy and Owen's wedding, injuring [[Father Christopher]], the priest marrying them, and both Nadia and Emma. They were taken to the emergency room, where Emma was admitted for observation, while Nadia's more severe injuries were assessed. She had numbness in her feet and an x-ray showed multiple spinal fractures. While they were examining her, she complained that she was overheated, so Link ordered an MRI as he suspected damage to her autonomic nervous system. By the time she got to the MRI, she was freezing. The MRI showed a tethered spinal cord and syrinx. She told the doctors she'd always had trouble with her back, but worked through it and was unaware that her spinal cord was tethered, which was causing the pain. They took her into surgery, where they repaired the first fracture and then flipped her to clip the cord and repair the other fracture. After Amelia clipped the cord, they briefly believed she was paralyzed, but they found that she was just bleeding and they were able to repair the damage. Her wife was told she'd make a full recovery, though the priest they hit died, leaving Emma worried Nadia would continue to hate her, as she believed Nadia already did.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Nadia Correa]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and Nadia have a son who just went off to college.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Correa, Emma}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
