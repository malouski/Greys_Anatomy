He had had his right lung removed when he was nine and was worried the other one was failing. [[Jackson Avery]] and [[Alex Karev]] couldn't find his heartbeat on examination. When his condition worsened, they did an x-ray and called [[Teddy Altman]], who found his heart down by his kidney, which is why he was having trouble breathing. They planned to use saline implants in his chest to move his heart back where it was supposed to be and hold it in place. The surgery went well and Molly was told he'd be fine.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is dating [[Molly (Push)|Molly]]. She asked him to move in with her right before he started having trouble breathing, so she thought it was an anxiety attack. She apologized when they found out it wasn't.\n\n===Familial===\nHis parents got married really young and he says they hated each other by the time he was born, which is why he didn't want to rush into things with Molly.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holmes, Todd}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
