She had a bowel resection to treat it and was in remission, but she was left with poor sphincter control.\n\n===Monica's Return to Work===\nOnce in remission, Monica planned a grand return to the stage. During rehearsals, she was able to get through it with frequent trips to the bathroom. However, in the first full run-through, she wasn't able to escape to the bathroom and she pooped on stage in the middle of a dance. She was humiliated and stopped dancing.\n\n===Monica's Sacral Nerve Stimulator===\nDr. Webber inserted a sacral nerve stimulator to reduce the frequency of Monica's bowel movements. However, it didn't work as well as he hoped and he decided to remove it.\n\n===Monica's Magnetic Sphincter===\nInspired by a similar procedure done at the base of the esophagus to reduce acid reflux, Dr. Murphy suggested they insert a magnetic sphincter to control Monica's bowels. Both Paul and Monica were excited to hear about the device and agreed to the surgery. The device was inserted successfully.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Monica Zarr]]====\nPaul is married to Monica Zarr.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zarr, Paul}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
