He'd had a cholecystectomy five days prior which seemed to have caused the fall. The doctors were shocked that he'd had an open cholecystectomy rather than a laparoscopic one. [[Margaret Campbell]], Seattle Grace's first female surgeon, had operated on him.\n\n[[Callie Torres]] told him his ankle fracture was minor, so she casted it and then he was taken for a CT. The CT revealed a lacerated bile duct, a serious mistake made during his first surgery. John was given the choice to have another surgeon do the repair, but he wanted Dr. Campbell because he liked and trusted her.\n\nHis second surgery went well.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nHe had a good relationship with his surgeon, [[Margaret Campbell]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 52 at the time of his fall.\n*He was the last person treated by [[Margaret Campbell]] in her career.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n5x16-1.jpg\n5x16-5.jpg\n5x16-10.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Terzian, John}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
