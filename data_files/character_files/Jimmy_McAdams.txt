[[Derek Shepherd]] was supposed to operate on him, but then his plane crashed. Because no one else would attempt to operate, Jimmy waited until Derek had recovered to have surgery.\n\n===Surgery===\nBy the time he was able to get his surgery, Jimmy was experiencing severe headaches and was so dizzy that he could barely stand up. Scans revealed that the tumor had progressed, which increased the risks of the surgery. He decided to proceed anyway.\n\nIn surgery, they had to test his facial function continuously. His face twitched throughout the surgery until after a bleeder. They had to wait until after he woke up to see if they had paralyzed half his face. After he woke up, he was able to hear and his facial expression was symmetrical.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nJimmy's sister, [[Carla McAdams|Carla]], took care of him while he was waiting on his surgery. She said that those months were the best of her life.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*His cousin sent him a jumbo cookie before surgery, even though he wasn't supposed to be eating. His sister ended up eating it.\n*His surgery was scheduled for 8 AM.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McAdams, Jimmy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
