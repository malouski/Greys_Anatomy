They started talking and quickly hit it off. Meredith, who had been planning to duck out as quickly as possible, soon realized she liked John and had to rearrange her afternoon so she could prolong the date. While she was doing this, John worried because he saw a woman who looked like the picture of the woman he was supposed to be meeting. She'd only had a name and since John is a common name, they'd both ended up with the wrong date. Their respective dates were chatting with each other happily, so they both texted their regrets and then left the restaurant before they could be spotted. Meredith and John went for a walk and talked about traveling, which they both enjoy. Then John said he dislikes kids and finds single mothers to be desperate. Meredith quickly ended the date and left.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====Ex-Wife====\nHe was married, but got divorced because his wife disliked the amount of time he spent working.\n\n====[[Meredith Grey]]====\nHe went on one date with Meredith.
