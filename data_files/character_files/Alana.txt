She agreed and off they went.\n\n===Car Accident===\nCharlie was speeding down the road, swerving around other cars, when he clipped the front end of [[Sarah|Sarah's]] car, sending both cars flying. Charlie and Alana were both ejected from the car, likely because they weren't wearing seat belts. Alana landed off in the grass on the side of the road, which Derek said was fortunate, because it was softer than the asphalt. She then alerted him to the fact that she wasn't in the car alone, leading him to search for and find Charlie, who had wandered away from the scene confused from a head injury.\n\nAlana kept clutching her belly, so Derek pulled up her shirt to take a look and found that her intestines were exposed. He used dry cleaning from Sarah's car to pack her abdomen and then wrapped it in plastic to keep her stable. When Charlie's dad's car exploded, the smoke alerted rescue workers to their location. Alana, along with the others, was loaded into an ambulance and taken to the ER at [[Dillard Medical Center]], where she was taken into surgery to repair her abdomen.\n\nRight before Derek was taken off life support, Meredith watched Alana's mother cry by her side.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was shocked, but happy when Charlie Abbott asked her if she wanted to go for a drive. They went for a drive, but it was cut short when Charlie crashed into another car while driving. They also kissed at some point during their time together. The only other guy she'd kissed was the second chair cellist and that was just for practice.\n\n===Familial===\nAfter the crash, Alana tried to call her mom but her phone wasn't working. She also said that her mom would be seriously disappointed in her because of what happened.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She's a mathlete.\n*She's taking 5 AP classes.\n*She's a first chair cellist.\n*Until the car accident, she'd had perfect attendance.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x21-2.jpg\n11x21-3.jpg\n11x21-20.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
