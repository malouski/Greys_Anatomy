She was taken to the ER with her bike still attached, as it was keeping her from bleeding out. In the ER, they extracted her bike and then she was taken in for surgery to put an external fixator on her femur fracture. ''(\"[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\")''\n\nAfter her surgery, she spiked a fever from an infection and crashed. They were able to resuscitate, but her tests showed necrotizing fasciitis. Wanting to improve her odds of survival, Jackson took her for debridement in the hyperbaric chamber. He was able to get down to viable tissue, but was shocked when she crashed. Link tried to get the message for them to check the external fixator. When they did, they learned the infection had spread. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to resuscitate her and she was pronounced dead. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer parents were in Japan when she got in her accident. When they heard, they immediately got on a flight to come to Seattle. When she was told she had necrotizing fasciitis, she asked Jackson to tell her mom she loved her and to thank her.\n\n===Friendships===\nIn the hospital, Cece decided to look out for Nisha because her parents weren't there and she felt guilty for hitting her. She pledged to stay at her bedside until her parents arrived, but was eventually forced out when Nisha developed an infection. She felt responsible when she learned Nisha had died.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She told Cece she'd never been in love.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n15x01Nisha.png|[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\n15x02Nisha.png|[[Broken Together]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Nisha Appearances}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ID)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
