Because his skin had grown directly on his heart, they had to separate that carefully and then [[Mark Sloan]] built him a new sternum to protect his heart. His surgery went well.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe has several sisters, but only one brother, [[Sefu]]. They are very close and Sefu was worried he was going to lose Kondo during his surgery.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
