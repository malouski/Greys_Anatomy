She was embarrassed by it and wouldn't even let her fianc\u00e9 stay in the room when she had to remove her robe so they could mark her incision points. She had also developed an umbilical hernia. The two procedures were combined into one operation. After surgery, she was able to get a sneak peek at her new abdomen and she and her fianc\u00e9 were both pleased by the results.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was engaged to Frank Myers. They had been together for two years and hadn't had sex because she cringed whenever he'd grab her abdomen. As such, she was eager to know how long after surgery she'd have to wait before they could have sex.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 30 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Meyers, Roxie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
