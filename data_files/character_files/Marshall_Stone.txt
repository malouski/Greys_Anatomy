His wrist was injured, so they called ortho while [[Derek Shepherd]] did a neuro exam and ordered a CT. Marshall was unable to recall four words less than a minute after being told them.\n\nCallie reduced and splinted his wrist and they waited for CT to be free. While he was waiting for the CT, Marshall got up and left. He went to the operating gallery and watched Melanie's surgery.\n\nHis CT was clear. Derek said the memory loss was from the concussion, but he wanted to keep him overnight to observe him.\n\nMarshall asked to apologize to Melanie's family. Her father was brought to his hospital room. Marshall apologized and after a moment where Jim looked very angry at him, he placed his hand on Marshall's face and they both cried.\n\n==Career==\nMarshall is a surgical intern at [[Mercy West Medical Center]]. He caused a car accident by falling asleep at the wheel after staying longer at work to observe a surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stone, Marshall}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
