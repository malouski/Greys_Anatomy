At the hospital, he was diagnosed with leriche syndrome, which affected the blood flow to that part of his body causing the weakness. Bailey then used his case as a skills lab for the residents, challenging them to come up with the same diagnosis she had and then having them practice the most difficult part of the surgery for the opportunity to do that piece of Wade's surgery. Taryn Helm won the challenge and in surgery, she completed her part easily, but he started bleeding profusely when they removed the clamps. Taryn panicked, so Andrew stepped in and finished the surgery on Wade.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was a pack-a-day smoker for 25 years before quitting.\n*He has high blood pressure.\n*He had a history of diverticulitis.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x02-12.jpg\n16x02-15.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foltz, Wade}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
