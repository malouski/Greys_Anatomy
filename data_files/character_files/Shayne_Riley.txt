She didn't know anyone, so she emailed all her co-workers asking them to meet for a weekend hike in Snoqualmie. Shayne was the only one who showed up, so they hiked together. They started dating and three months later, the pandemic hit. They decided to move in together to have guaranteed, COVID-free sex. Then they decided to get married, to do something happy.\n\nAfter getting married, Karissa and Shayne went over to [[SFD Station 19|station 19]] to get tested for COVID. As they were leaving, they ended up being tailgated by a truck. The truck then passed them, but hit something and the loading ramp came out of the back of the truck. Shayne tried to stop the car, but didn't have time and they drove up the ramp into the back of the truck. Karissa had only minor lacerations, but Shayne was crushed between the steering wheel and the car. When station 19 arrived at the scene, Andy climbed in the back of their car to check on them and put collars on their necks. Then she started two IVs in Shayne to stabilize him as much as possible while they waited for USAR to arrive.\n\nWhile they waited, Karissa started panicking about being trapped in the car and begged them to save her first because she had people who cared about her and needed her, unlike Shayne, who only had her. Soon after, they cut through the side of the truck and pulled Shayne out that way. They got him onto a stretcher, put a temporary binding on his pelvis, and sent him to the hospital. Then they got Karissa out and put her in a separate aid car to the hospital. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, Shayne and Karissa were taken to separate rooms to be treated. An x-ray showed an open-book pelvic fracture, so they placed a binder on his pelvis and then took him to CT to check for additional abdominal injuries and then to surgery, where they repaired his pelvis. After surgery, he was told he'd need some rehab, but he'd recover completely. He then asked to speak to Karissa. He asked her for an annulment, saying he'd ignored her self-absorption and now knew she wouldn't change and he didn't find it cute anymore. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Karissa Skolaski]]. He says he knew early on that she was the love of his life. They got married during the [[COVID-19 Pandemic]] after isolating together to ensure regular sex. However, after they were in an accident, Karissa begged to be saved first, despite him being more seriously injured, saying that she had people who cared about her and he didn't have anyone but her. ''(\"[[Save Yourself]]\")'' After hearing these remarks, Shayne asked her for an annulment.
