Baker fire and later died from his injuries.\n\n==History==\nWhile fighting a wildfire on Mt. Baker, Casey was severely burned. He was taken to the ER, where he insisted that the doctors treat the other firefighters first. He'd been burned several times in previous fires, to the point where his wife said he smells like bacon. When [[Miranda Bailey]] examined him, she was able to see his lung from the outside. There wasn't an available OR, so they moved him to a burn unit bed. Due to a partially-collapsed lung and severe smoke inhalation, Casey struggled to breathe. The injuries were also putting strain on his body, causing heart failure. However, he refused to be intubated as his wife was on her way and he wanted to talk to her. He and the doctors both knew he was going to die, so they kept him comfortable as they waited for his wife to arrive. When [[Ruth]] got to the hospital, they spoke for a few minutes, both acknowledging that he was dying and they knew that was coming someday. She sat with him and they talked until he died a few moments later.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Ruth]]. He once burned himself on the oven making a birthday cake for his wife's 50th birthday. Because of his work as a firefighter, they both had accepted the reality that he could die in the performance of his duties. When the time came, she sat with him while he died.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have two children, Doug and Susan. When Ruth got the call about Casey, she called the kids and said that their father loves them and they told her they love him, too.\n\n==Career==\nHe was a firefighter with the [[Seattle Fire Department]]. He had a burn scar on his thigh from a previous wildfire and one on his shoulder. While fighting a fire on Mt. Baker, he was seriously burned and later died of his injuries.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was the only person to die in the Mt. Baker fire.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" bordersize=\"none\">\n12x08-7.jpg\n12x08-8.jpg\n12x08-9.jpg\n12x08-10.jpg\n12x08-11.jpg\n12x08-12.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Casey}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Firefighters]]"}}}]}}}}
