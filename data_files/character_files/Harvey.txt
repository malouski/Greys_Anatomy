After the presentation, Derek and Jackson went to Harvey and offered to fix his hemifacial spasm. He was reluctant, but they talked him into it with help from [[Richard Webber]].\n\nThe surgery was successful and afterward, Harvey looked at himself in the mirror in awe, expecting it to twitch as it had for the past 20 years. Derek happily told him that it wouldn\u2019t.\n\n==Career==\nHarvey sells 3-D printers and ink cartridges.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
