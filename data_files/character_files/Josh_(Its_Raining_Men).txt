Josh went with her to the hospital, covered in blood himself. While Alicia was getting treatment, Josh had a panic attack. Link helped him calm down. Josh then found a human toe in the hood of his hoodie, which freaked him out more. Link took him to get cleaned up and gave him a pair of scrubs to wear. Josh was later told that Alicia hadn't survived her surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was dating Alicia Chen until her death. They met in biochemistry. When asked if he had contact information for her parents, he said they'd only known each other for a month and he didn't even know her parents' names.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Josh}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
