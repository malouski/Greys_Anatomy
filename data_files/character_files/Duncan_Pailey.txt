He was scared and didn't want to have surgery, so he ran from his room and pulled a fire alarm.\n\nIn order to get him to let them put in an IV, George let Meredith put one in his arm to show him how it works. He then had the idea to show Duncan a patient having surgery in order to ease his fears about that. George got permission and first accidentally took Duncan into the wrong OR, where he saw [[Arnie Grandy]] with his face pulled down. He was then taken to the correct OR, where he said the surgery was boring, though he was told his would be boring as well.\n\nWhen he was taken into surgery, he was excited that the surgery would be recorded, saying he wanted to see everything. His surgery went well.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nDuncan's parents came to the hospital with him. They were extremely worried about him, especially when he tried to refuse surgery.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 8 at the time of his heart surgery.\n*He likes planes.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pailey, Duncan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
