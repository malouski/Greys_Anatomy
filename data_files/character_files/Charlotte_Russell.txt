When their mother was 32 weeks pregnant, she was hospitalized until she was ready to deliver, which she hoped would not be until 36 weeks. However, she started having contractions at just 32 weeks. They put her in trendellenberg and put her on magnesium to try to stop the labor. Despite their efforts, her placenta started tearing, forcing them to deliver all five babies at 32 weeks. ''(\"[[Much too Much]]\")''\n\n===Infancy===\nCharlotte's lungs were a little less developed than her sisters', so they put a special mask on her to help her breathe and monitored her. Her lung collapsed, but they were able to put in a chest tube to help her breathe. She later stopped breathing again and had to be intubated. When she continued to struggle, Meredith had the idea to put Kate in the isolette with her. This quickly improved her numbers. ''(\"[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe is part of a set of quintuplets. Their parents also have a set of triplets.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was lodged under her mother's rib cage.<ref>[[Much too Much]], 2x10</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Charlotte Russell Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Russell, Charlotte}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neonatal)]]"}}}]}}}}
