He had passed out because of sick sinus syndrome, for which he needed an ablation. While he was in the ER, he saw [[Betty Donahue]], whom he had loved when he was young. He had his ablation and afterward, he was put in a room with Betty so they could catch up. He also had a diaphragmatic rupture, but they said that could wait while they caught up.\n\nHe was taken in for surgery to repair his diaphragm. It was successful, but afterward, he was having irregular heart rhythms, so they inserted a pacemaker. Betty then agreed to move across the country to be with him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====Irene Stamm====\nHe was married to Irene Stamm. She died 10 years before his cruise accident.\n\n====Betty Donahue====\nWhile he was engaged to Irene, he met Betty at a party and they had sex. Despite this, he still married Irene.

She agreed after some reluctance.\n\n===Familial===\nHis kids bought him a cruise to Alaska. His daughter said he might meet a nice woman on the cruise.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 75 at the time of his cruise accident.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x22-4.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stamm, Henry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
