She was in the hospital to have the extra skin removed. She had also developed an umbilical hernia, so the two procedures were combined into one surgery. After surgery, Roxie and Frank got a sneak peek at her new abdomen and they were both pleased by the results.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nFrank was engaged to Roxie Meyers, whom he had been with for two years. Because of her excess skin from the weight loss, they'd never had sex, something they were eager to change after her surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Myers, Frank}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
