After he hit Anthony, he swerved and hit a telephone pole, injuring himself. In the ER, they examined him. He had a ruptured ear drum and a ZMC fracture. He also had an injured facial nerve. Derek and Mark argued over which injuries took precedence. They talked to Dan about his injuries and he was upset because he was just trying to drive to the bank.\n\nThey took him into surgery and repaired his injuries.
