As a result of the fall, he had accidentally fired seven nails into his head. When he arrived at the hospital, he was unable to see. The doctors did research into the best way to deal with the situation and only discovered that they should try to get them out as quickly as possible and watch for heavy bleeding. His wife then revealed that he'd been having headaches and dizzy spells, so after Derek removed the nails, he started looking for possible causes. The next morning, Jorge's sight had returned, but an MRI to check for bleeding revealed a tumor on his hypothalamus. Jorge was given his options. He could either have 3-5 quality years with focused radiation or he could have the tumor almost completely removed, which would give him 5-10 years, but since the tumor was where his personality lived, there was a chance he'd lose his memories and his personality. Jorge decided on the surgery and his wife supported his decision.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to Jorge Cruz. They have a very loving relationship. She makes him a cheese omelet every morning for breakfast, which she says is the only thing he likes and he says is the only thing she knows how to make. When they had to choose between 3-5 good years or 5-10 years with Jorge's personality possibly being altered, Jorge chose the 5-10 years, which Zona supported, saying that he's still her Jorge and she'll remember their life together for both of them.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her favorite color is red.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n104-9.jpg\n104-10.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cruz, Zona}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
