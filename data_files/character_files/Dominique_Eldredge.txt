When they arrived, she was short with them and clear about what she expected from them. When she took them into the room to examine Kristen, Kristen attacked her, dislocating her finger. She ordered Kristen be put in four-point restraints for 24 hours as punishment and when Kristen's lawyer, [[Amanda Joseph]], objected, she offered to place a call to the Sheriff about it. Bailey followed her into the hallway, where she was shocked to see Eldredge brush off her concern and reduce her own finger. She then left to buddy tape it to the next finger.\n\nWhen Bailey treated another inmate, [[Lee]], and complained about the lack of available supplies, Eldredge took her into the supply closet and showed her that supplies were limited, leaving her to make difficult decisions about how to ration them among all the patients.\n\nEldredge was present in the room when Kristen eventually went into labor and started to deliver her baby. When the GSM doctors pleaded with her to remove two of the restraints, which were hurting Kristen's wrists as she pushed, she initially said it was too dangerous, but she eventually relented and had the restraints removed.\n\nShe later told the doctors that Kristen would be kept in the prison ward for a few days to recover and then she'd go back in the general prison population to serve the rest of her sentence. She and Bailey expressed their mutual respect and each offered a job to the other if she ever finds herself looking.\n\n==Career==\nEldredge is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Emergency Medicine|emergency medicine physician]] at Tri-County Hospital on the prison floor. Due to budget cuts, she had to make difficult decisions about how to distribute resources among patients.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Although not explicitly stated, Eldredge is implied to be the [[Emergency Medicine|EM]] [[Attending#Department Head|head]] as she makes the decisions for emergency medicine resource allocation, she's able to override prison protocol regarding patient restraints, and she's able to hire staff (as she extended an invitation to [[Miranda Bailey]] if the latter wanted a new job).\n*She had 26 patients, including 8 who were pregnant.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x10-2.jpg\n13x10-3.jpg\n13x10-4.jpg\n13x10-5.jpg\n13x10-9.jpg\n13x10-12.jpg\n13x10-14.jpg\n13x10-15.jpg\n13x10-17.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eldredge, Dominique}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
