In the ER, Kai also started coughing up blood. They did did a bronchoscopy, which show no bleeding in his lungs, just inflammation. They also found bleeding in his esophagus, so they took him to CT. This showed that his lungs had significant damage. Cormac was certain he had been vaping. His friends confirmed it. Cormac suggested repairing the esophagus and removing part of his lung, but Meredith said they could try coiling to stop the bleeding and preserve his lung. Meredith tried it, but it failed, so they had to do a thoracotomy and remove a portion of his lung, permanently reducing his lung capacity. Daniel expressed regret that he hadn't realized sooner what Kai was doing.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis son, Kai, vaped without his knowledge until the vaping damaged his lungs so much that he required surgery to remove a portion.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x11-22.jpg\n16x11-25.jpg\n16x11-26.jpg\n16x11-27.jpg\n16x11-28.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hale, Daniel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
