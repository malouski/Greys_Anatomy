After three months of chemotherapy, the doctors were ready for the next step of his treatment: removing the cancerous portion of his leg and then turning his lower leg around and attaching it to the upper part, making his ankle take the place of his knee. The hope was that with prosthetics and rehab, he'd be able to play baseball again. His surgery went well and, while his leg looked odd to him at first, the doctors were hopeful that he'd be able to play as well as he'd played before.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis mother, [[Jenny Martinez]], was upset to learn that Hunter had known about his cancer for three months and hadn't told her. His reasoning for not telling her was that he knew she'd worry.\n\n===Professional===\nHe knew [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]] from his time working for the Mariners.\n\n==Career==\nHe's a minor league baseball player. He hopes that with his new leg and prosthetics, he'll be called up to the majors.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 20 at the time of his surgery.\n*He wears #20.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martinez, Huntery}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
