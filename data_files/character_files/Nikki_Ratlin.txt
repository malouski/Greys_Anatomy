She went to his house one day to surprise him and climbed a tree to check if his dog was in the yard. While she was in the tree, it was struck by lightning and she fell to the ground.\n\nWhen she got to the hospital, she told the doctors she'd been struck by lightning. After inquiring further about her injuries, she told them that the tree had been struck and fell on her. They asked her to be honest going forward. Her leg was broken, so [[Callie Torres]] realigned the bones and casted it. She also asked about bruising on Nikki's side, concerned that the boyfriend might have hit her. She then admitted that she'd been in the tree when it was struck and fell to the ground.\n\nDue to the fall, she had a severe splenic laceration that needed surgery, but Nikki heard through the grapevine that there had been four surgical deaths that morning and they were expecting three more. She didn't want to be one of them, so she refused to have surgery until after midnight. The doctors assured her that they didn't have the time to wait, but she wouldn't budge. Later that night, she started bleeding out and despite their best efforts, she was pronounced dead.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe'd been dating a man named Kevin. He dumped her, but she continued to try to see him. She even fell out of a tree in his yard while checking to see if his dog was in the yard.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was very superstitious.\n*She was 30 at the time of her death.\n*She read her horoscope.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ratlin, Nikki}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
