He was rushed to the ER still attached to his car seat. The doctors assessed his injuries and then freed him from the seat. They then cut off enough of the branch that they could lay him flat, but not before he had to be intubated through his nose because they couldn't use his throat. He was then rushed to surgery, where the branch was removed. They had to remove his spleen and part of his stomach. Pierce was able to avert a lung crisis and they repaired his diaphragm. After his surgery, he was doing well.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 37 at the time of his accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hays, Charlie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
