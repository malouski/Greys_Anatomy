Since her husband, Bryan, was out shopping, she called a taxi. [[Steve Duncan]] came and told her to get in the front seat so she could recline. He then started a video chat with the hospital so he could give them information as he drove to the hospital. When they were only a few blocks away, Arizona told Mindy to put her legs up when she felt the baby descend so she'd be more comfortable. Shortly after that, they were hit by another car.\n\nThe doctors rushed out to the car to get Mindy into the hospital. In the ER, she had a strong fetal heartbeat, but an x-ray showed that both her hips were dislocated and broken, forcing the bones upward into her chest and abdomen, a result of having her feet up on the dashboard. She was taken for a CT, which showed a splenic laceration and internal bleeding. She was rushed into an emergency surgery, first to deliver the baby and then to repair her injuries. She asked if her husband could be there for the birth, since she was going to be unconscious herself. Arizona agreed, but said he'd need to leave immediately after the birth. Before she was anesthetized, Mindy noticed the scratches on her husband's face and against Arizona's advice, he revealed he was the one who had hit her on his way to the hospital.\n\nOnce Mindy was out, the baby was delivered and didn't breathe right away. They determined that she had a diaphragmatic hernia. Arizona had to leave Mindy's surgery to operate on the baby. Maggie finished her surgery and her husband was told she was alive, but still not out of the woods. Their daughter's surgery went well and Bryan was told she'd be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Bryan Wallace]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband have a daughter.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x11-5.jpg\n13x11-7.jpg\n13x11-8.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wallace, Mindy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
