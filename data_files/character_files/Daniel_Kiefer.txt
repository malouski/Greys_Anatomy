His parents were tested as potential matches for him and his sister, who had the same type of tumor, but only their father was a match, meaning that a choice had to be made to save one or the other. They were tested aggressively to see which of them was more likely to survive the transplant, but their statuses were roughly equal, complicating the decision. Alex Karev eventually decided that he needed to open both of them up and take a look directly at the tumors before he could make a decision. Once he did so, he decided that Emma would get the liver. While Emma got her transplant, Alex decided to try a last-ditch effort to save both and attempted to resect Daniel's tumor. However, Daniel arrested after the tumor was resected and Alex took him off the machines and held him while he died.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe and his twin sister, Emma, were both born with aggressive liver tumors. When Emma was determined to have a better chance for survival, she received a liver transplant from their father and Daniel died.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was the younger of the twins.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kiefer, Daniel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neonatal)]]"}}}]}}}}
