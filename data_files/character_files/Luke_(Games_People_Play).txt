He had minor injuries that were treated in the ER. Later, he and a couple other players got in an argument about who was responsible for the fight on the field. Owen pinned him to the floor by his hand and demanded that they all stop fighting because their fighting had already cost him two good doctors.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Luke}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
