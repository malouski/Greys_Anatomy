He was taken into surgery to repair the damage. After his surgery, the cause of the damage was still a mystery. When he was informed of that, he mentioned the rash on Marion's wrist, which she was scratching. An examination revealed a worm under her skin, which [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] believed to be the cause of Jake's problems. They contracted the worm when they ate sushi from a train station while in Thailand.\n\nThey put Jake on anti-parasitics and waited for the worm to die. Scans showed no further damage, but he was unsettled not knowing where the worm was. Then his legs went numb and he lost feeling in his arms and legs. Scans showed that the worm had eaten through his vertebrae, so [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] operated to remove the worm and repair the damage.\n\nIn surgery, the damage was even worse than expected, but Derek removed the worm from the C-4 vertebrae.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Marion Steiner]]. They had been married and divorced twice before. For their first honeymoon, they went to Kauai. For the second, they went to Fiji. For their third, they went to Thailand, which is where they both contracted a parasite.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He and Marion had been on three honeymoons in the previous 12 years.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Steiner, Jake}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
