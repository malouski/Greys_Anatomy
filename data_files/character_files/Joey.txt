He said that [[Henry Flynn]] had hit a deer and [[Nancy Walters]] hit Henry and he hit Nancy. While he was being examined, he said he was hungry and asked if he could have something to eat. He shattered his patella, but his x-rays looked good and he didn't need surgery, so his knee was splinted.\n\nWhile he was waiting, Joey ate several non-food items from around his room. One of them perforated his abdomen, so he had to be taken into surgery, where several items were removed from his abdomen. He had pica, the urge to eat non-food items. They called for a psych consult to come after his surgery was finished.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 45 at the time of his car accident.\n*He had swallowed $2.37 in change.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x01-20.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
