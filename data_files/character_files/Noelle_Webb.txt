She was taken to the hospital, where they discovered she had abdominal bleeding from a tear. Her blood sugar was also very high. When pressed, she admitted that she was struggling to make ends meet after putting her parents in assisted living and it didn't always leave enough for her. She'd been rationing her insulin to make it last, which is why she felt dizzy and passed out in the first place. Meredith ordered a CT and determined she needed surgery urgently. She coded shortly afterward and was rushed to surgery, where despite their best efforts, she died.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe had recently put her parents in assisted living and the cost of that forced her to take on odd jobs and ration her insulin.\n\n==Career==\nShe had an account with Giggle Days, which she used to take on small jobs to help her make ends meet.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 43 at the time of her death.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x17-12.jpg\n16x17-13.jpg\n16x17-14.jpg\n16x17-15.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Webb, Noelle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
