But the carousel never stops turning. You can't get off.|'''Ellis Grey'''}}\n\n'''Ellis Grey''' was the mother of [[Meredith Grey]] and the ex-wife of [[Thatcher Grey]]. She was also the birth mother of [[Maggie Pierce]]. During her time, she was a world-famous surgeon who was twice honored with the Harper Avery Award. She was later diagnosed with [[Medical Glossary#A|Alzheimer's]].\n\n==History==\n===Early Life===\nEllis was born on August 6, 1953. Little to nothing is known about her childhood. At some point in her life, she met [[Thatcher Grey]]. They married, and welcomed [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] into their lives in early 1978, aged 24 at the time.  \n\n===Meredith's Birth===\nWhen she was pregnant with Meredith, she refused to acknowledge it at any point. When she went into labor, she came to Thatcher in awe, laughing and smiling, finally admitting that they were having a baby. On his deathbed, he said he'd never seen her so happy and carefree before. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n===First Seattle AIDS Patient===\nStarting in 1982, when he first came to the hospital, Ellis, along with [[Richard Webber]], treated [[Phillip Nichols]], who ultimately ended up being the first patient in Seattle to be diagnosed with GRID, now known as AIDS. They operated on him even without knowing how AIDS was transmitted. They later stood by his bedside as he died and later toasted his death at [[Emerald City Bar]], where Ellis convinced Richard to toast with alcohol instead of soda. ''(\"[[The Time Warp]]\")''\n\n===Affair with Richard===\nMeanwhile, Ellis had finished med school and started her [[Resident|surgical residency]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], where she was often looked down on because she was one of the few and first female surgeons. Due to her large professional drive and her wanting to prove herself, she worked long hours and didn't spend much time with her family.\n\n[[File:11x04RichardLeavesEllis.png|thumb|250px|Ellis is left alone after Richard chooses Adele.]]\n\nShe bonded with her fellow resident [[Richard Webber|Richard]], who was also being looked down on because of his skin color. They soon started off an affair and began planning a life together. In June 1983, the two of them made a deal to tell their spouses about their affair and leave them, as they didn't want to continue cheating. Right after making the deal, Richard overheard that Ellis was put on the shortlist for the Harper Avery Award for the Grey Method, being the first resident to ever make it onto that list. That night, Ellis told Thatcher, but Richard chose to be with his wife, [[Adele Webber|Adele]] because he was hopelessly jealous of Ellis's professional success and didn't want to feel like that his entire life. \n\n[[File:11x04EllisSlitWrists.png|thumb|250px|Ellis slit her wrists.]]\n===Suicide Attempt===\nDevastated over the fact that Richard left her, Ellis slit her wrists in front of Meredith on June 19, 1983. Ellis told Meredith not to be scared of the blood and forbade her to call 911. Eventually, Ellis passed out, and Meredith called 911. She was transported to the ER and her life was saved, thanks to Meredith. Eventually, Meredith learned that Ellis, being the fantastic surgeon that she was, would have known that the way she slit her wrists would not have killed her, making it clear to her that it was not a suicide attempt, but rather a cry for Richard's attention.\n\n===Pregnancy===\nWhile being treated, Ellis was discovered to be pregnant with Richard's child, which is why she decided to move to Boston. She stopped drinking wine and wrote down what she ate in her journals, indicating Ellis did want her baby to be healthy. Ellis took her daughter with her and they hid in their apartment. Ellis cried a lot, but Meredith knew not to ask any questions. Eventually, Ellis's water broke and she gave birth to [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] on November 22, 1983, giving her up for adoption. She was sure she wanted to sign away all her rights to the baby, because she needed to start over after Richard left her.\n\n===Living in Boston===\nThen, Ellis and Meredith didn't have to hide anymore, so they moved across town to a nice house. Meredith started first grade and Ellis started her fellowship at [[Massachusetts General Hospital|Mass Gen]], continuing her career.\n\n===Alzheimer's===\nWhen Meredith started her internship, Ellis was suffering from Alzheimer's and resided at the [[Roseridge Home for Extended Care]]. Her case was advanced, and she most often thought she was still completing her residency. When she talked to Meredith, she sometimes thought she was a friend of hers from college.\n\nAfter her disease progressed to the point where she could no longer handle her own affairs, they had her sign everything over to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]]. ''(\"[[Shake Your Groove Thing]]\")''\n\n===Hospitalization===\nEllis was brought to the hospital with cramping pain and diarrhea. Because of her Alzheimer's, she was confused and aggressive. She believed that [[George O'Malley|George]] was Thatcher and [[Preston Burke|Burke]] was Richard. Scans confirmed diverticulitis, but also revealed a liver mass. They biopsied the mass, but it was found to be benign. ''(\"[[Make Me Lose Control]]\")''\n\nThey removed the mass and three days later, she was stable and recovering well. She disappeared from her hospital bed and was found around the hospital wearing scrubs and thinking she was still a doctor. They got her to come back to her room, but she disappeared again, this time going to a scrub room to prepare for a surgery she believed she'd be doing. Because of her multiple escapes, she had to be put in restraints. ''(\"[[Deny, Deny, Deny]]\")''\n\nOnce she had recovered, she was discharged back to Roseridge. ''(\"[[Bring the Pain]]\")''\n\n===Alzheimer's Trial===\nAfter finding out that Ellis had Alzheimer's, Richard began to visit her at Roseridge. He then asked Derek to come check on Ellis and see if she was eligible for an Alzheimer's research trial. She was and Richard convinced Meredith to agree. ''(\"[[Begin the Begin]]\")''\n\n===Richard's Visits===\nRichard started visiting Ellis after her Alzheimer's was revealed to him. They shared stories of their residency, a time she remembered well. Meredith saw them together and after thinking about it, told Richard he should keep visiting her as it made her happy. ''(\"[[Break on Through]]\")''\n\n===Refusal to Eat===\nThe nursing home called Meredith because Ellis had been refusing to eat. Ellis said she didn't have time because she was working. When Richard showed up with food for her, she immediately started eating it. Meredith later had to break the news to Ellis that Richard wouldn't be visiting her anymore because he'd decided to commit himself back to his marriage. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nWhile reliving the first time Richard left her, she had to be reminded that it had happened thirty years prior. ''(\"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\")''\n\n===Lucidity===\nOne morning, Ellis woke up in her nursing home completely lucid. She remembered everything except the last five years and the fact that she had Alzheimer's. [[Ms. Henry]] thought it was best that Meredith tell her about the Alzheimer's. Ellis apologized to Meredith for the fight they'd had and tried to figure out why she was in a home. Meredith told her she had Alzheimer's and that she lived in a residential facility. Ellis started to cry and then collapsed and had to be rushed to the hospital. They ran tests to determine the cause of her arrhythmias. Because she was in the Alzheimer's research trial, she asked for a consult with the neurosurgeon who got her into the trial. When she met with Derek, she figured out that Meredith was seeing him. Ellis was diagnosed with a heart condition that could be treated with meds, but Burke decided to do surgery because Meredith said she's often not compliant with medication. She tried to refuse the surgery, but since Meredith was her medical proxy, it wasn't Ellis's decision to make. Meredith said she wouldn't let Ellis refuse the surgery because she said killing her mother wouldn't be another thing that happened to her. During her last lucid moments, she reminisced with Richard about the life they could have had together. Meredith came back and told Ellis that she still hoped they'd find a cure and the two of them would have another chance to get to know each other, but by then, she wasn't lucid anymore. ''(\"[[Wishin' and Hopin']]\")''\n\n===Death===\nEllis became agitated and aggressive, so she was given lorazepam to calm her down. Later that day, she coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n===Posthumous History===\n====Meredith's Near-Death Experience====\nWhen Meredith drowned in [[Elliott Bay]], she saw her mother in a sort of afterlife, saying she didn't belong there. She said that Meredith was anything but ordinary before telling her to run. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n====Ashes====\nShe was later cremated, put into a beautiful urn, and for a time was \"hanging out in the back of Meredith's closet.\" ''(\"[[Scars and Souvenirs]]\")''\n\nBecause Meredith thought that Ellis' ashes were haunting her, she took them to work and washed them down a surgical sink at the hospital with [[Richard Webber|Richard]], who saw it as a fitting tribute for her final resting place to be so closely associated with the hospital which she dedicated her life to. ''(\"[[Haunt You Every Day]]\")''\n\n====Day of the Dead====\nEllis was among the spirits who visited Meredith on Day of the Dead. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n====Meredith's Dream====\nEllis appeared to Meredith in a dream, first giving constructive criticism to Maggie about her article and then telling Zola an idea for Meredith and having her write it down. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\n====Meredith's Next Dream====\nEllis appeared to Meredith in another dream years later, asking Meredith what she was going to do next after surviving the unbelievable. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n===Alternate Universe===\nIn the alternate universe, Ellis never developed Alzheimer's, Richard chose her instead of Adele, and they raised Meredith together. Ellis is also Chief of Surgery and Chief of Staff at Seattle Grace. ''(\"[[If/Then]]\")''\n\n==Personality==\nShe was extremely overbearing, intense, arrogant, driven, determined, and hardworking.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Richard Webber]]====\n[[File:3x01EllisRichardFlashback.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Richard leaves Ellis for Adele.]]\nDuring her residency, she had an affair with former [[Seattle Grace Hospital|SGH]] Chief of [[Surgery]], [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]], when they were both residents. As residents, the two doctors had a defining moment in both their careers and their relationship when they took care of one of the first patients diagnosed with G.R.I.D. (Gay-related immune deficiency, an early name for AIDS).\n\nLate in their relationship, Ellis became pregnant by Richard. She gave [[Maggie Pierce|the baby]] up for adoption at birth.\n\nEllis decided to slit her wrists in front of Meredith and forbade her to call an ambulance. When her mother passed out Meredith rang an ambulance and her mother lived. Years later, with the help of her psychiatrist, Meredith realized that her mother wasn't trying to commit suicide, she cut her wrists in the hopes that Richard would find out and take her back. However, Richard never heard about the incident and she was too stubborn to ask.\n\n====[[Thatcher Grey]]====\nShe was married to [[Thatcher Grey]], who left the family when Meredith was young, partly as a result of Ellis's affair. Ellis and Richard planned to leave their respective partners and get married but eventually, Richard chose Adele over Ellis, although he did still have feelings for her.\n\n===Friendships===\n====[[Marie Cerone]]====\nEllis and Marie were great friends for years until they had a falling out. ''(\"[[Games People Play]]\")''\n\nMeredith learned that Ellis and Marie had worked together on what won Ellis's second Harper Avery, but Ellis had taken all the credit. Many years later, Marie wanted Meredith to publicly make it known that the work was not just Ellis's. ''(\"[[Old Scars, Future Hearts]]\")''\n\n===Professional===\n====[[Elizabeth Fallon]]====\nLiz Fallon was Ellis's scrub nurse for 18 years. When Liz was dying of cancer, Meredith went to see her. During the visit Liz made a comment about Ellis's perfect memory and Meredith couldn't stop laughing, so Liz asked what Ellis was diagnosed with. Shocked, Meredith ended up telling Liz about Ellis's Alzheimer's. Liz revealed that while she'd been Ellis's scrub nurse, she never met Meredith. When Meredith mentioned meeting Liz, Ellis remembered her fondly, that she was a great scrub nurse, asking how she was. ''(\"[[No Man's Land]]\")''\n\nIt is unclear when those 18 years occurred as Liz Fallon worked at Seattle Grace and Ellis left Seattle after her residency and later worked at Mass Gen, The Mayo Clinic and for the U.N. It has been strongly implied that she never returned to work at Seattle Grace.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Ellissaysgoodbye.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ellis tells Meredith to be extraordinary.]]\nEllis completed her [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She was the only female in her residency class. During her residency, along with [[Richard Webber]], she treated and identified the hospital's first GRID (now known as AIDS) patient. During her final year of residency, Ellis created an audacious laparoscopic technique to treat gallbladders and subsequently named it, audaciously, \"The Grey Method\" when it was published in The American Journal of Medicine. She listed herself as the first author, and it put her on the short list for her first Harper Avery nomination. The nomination itself was groundbreaking as no resident ever had been nominated.\n\nAt the time she developed the \"Grey Method,\" she worked very closely with her colleague and then best friend, [[Marie Cerone]]. [[Games People Play|According to Marie]], she and Ellis developed the method together. However, when the time came to publishing the paper, Ellis left Marie's name off of it and listed only herself. Ellis did this due to the fact that Marie was blacklisted from ever being eligible to win a Harper Avery. After Ellis' death during a [[Fight For Your Mind|public presentation]] of Meredith's own research, Meredith announces that the \"Grey Method\" would now be known as the [[Fight For Your Mind|\"Grey-Cerone Method\"]] to acknowledge Marie's contributions.\n\nAfter her divorce with Thatcher and break-up with Richard, Ellis moved with Meredith to pursue a [[Fellow|fellowship]] position at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She then won the Harper Avery and dedicated the win to all the female surgeons in the world that would come after her. Ellis continued to be a pioneer in surgery as her distinguished career included tenures at [[Boston General]], the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota and for the U.N., and won another Harper Avery award.\n\nShe has also documented a significant aspect of her surgical training, in the form of videos, which were watched while the group were still interns, and in her [[Ellis Grey's Journals|journals]], writing about her relationship with Richard and her surgical training, referencing staff at Seattle Grace, such as [[Margaret Campbell]], and which Cristina greatly enjoys, for both medicine and romance. According to her journals, the decision of whether or not Ellis would get the first solo surgery was the greatest and most terrifying moment in her life.\n\nEllis wrote at least one book, as Richard supposed she took time off to write another one. ''(\"[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was allergic to penicillin.<ref>[[Make Me Lose Control]], 2x03</ref>\n*Ellis said that carousels gave her the creeps.<ref>[[Bring the Pain]], 2x05</ref>\n*Her patient ID at Seattle Grace Hospital was 188032-11.<ref>[[Got to Be Real]], 11x03</ref>\n*In her Alzheimer's state, she believed that [[George O'Malley|George]] was [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]]<ref>[[Make Me Lose Control]], 2x03</ref>, that [[Preston Burke|Burke]] was [[Richard Webber|Richard]] and that [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] was a close friend from college.\n*[[Richard Webber|Richard]] had mentioned that had she not moved to Boston, Ellis would have been [[Chief of Surgery|chief of surgery]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. In an [[If/Then|alternative universe]] episode, it explores the possibility as she was both [[Chief of Staff|chief of staff]] and chief of surgery at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n*She first met [[Richard Webber]] when [[Meredith Grey|her daughter]] was three.\n*As Meredith (born 1978), was 5 in June 1983, when Richard chose to stay with [[Adele Webber|Adele]], Ellis (born August 1953) would have been 24 when she gave birth to her daughter. \n*According to Richard in [[I'm Winning]], she won her first [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]] in 1988, when she was a resident. This is inconsistent with information provided in the following season.\n**Ellis started her fellowship in Mass Gen after placing [[Maggie Pierce]] for adoption in 1983. As Ellis was already a resident in 1982, it is likely she also would have completed her residency by 1988.\n**It is heavily implied Richard and Ellis did not speak after he decided to stay with [[Adele Webber|Adele]], though it is possible he reunited with her for when she won.\n***(Though it is also possible Ellis took time after leaving Seattle Grace to apply for a different residency program, while managing single parenthood.  It is also possible Richard misremembered, and this was the second Harper Avery Award win, as the Grey Method was established in 1983).\n*She was nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]] five times in total.\n*Ellis was with Richard when she was told she was nominated for her first Harper Avery Award.\n*Her granddaughter, [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]], was named after her.\n*She was afraid of heights.<ref>[[Haunt You Every Day]], 4x05</ref>\n*Her favorite OR was OR 2.<ref>[[Be Still, My Soul]], 13x18</ref>\n*After winning the [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]], Meredith imagined she saw her mother clapping for her.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], 14x07</ref>\n*The character was originally named Helen before the writers chose Ellis.
