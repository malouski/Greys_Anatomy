They were rushed to the hospital, where Omar had severe abdominal bleeding. When a [[Hospital Codes#Code Pink|Code Pink]] was called while he was in a trauma room, they prepared to do a thoracotomy in the ER, but the Code Pink was lifted before that became necessary and he was taken into an OR for surgery. ''(\"[[There's a Fine, Fine Line]]\")''\n\nAfter his surgery, he went into cardiac arrest and was put on therapeutic hypothermia. He was breathing spontaneously and started to wake up, but then he started seizing. The seizure left him without oxygen prolongedly. When his mother, [[Mira Singh|Mira]], arrived at the hospital, she was told he might not wake up and if he did, they wouldn't know about possible deficits because there wasn't much brain activity. Mira was told she could sign DNR papers or they could continue to attempt resuscitation. Jasmine overheard and said she should sign the papers, saying he wouldn't want to live in a bed like that and he'd want to be with Gretchen. Mira agreed to sign the papers. Shortly after, Omar started crashing as his condition declined. Bailey said he hadn't had any more seizure activity, so they could give him medication and fluids to help his heart, but Mira declined, saying her son was gone.\n\nWhen he went into v-tach while his mom and kids were out of the room, Bailey decided to ignore the DNR and defibrillate, which was successful and restored sinus rhythm. Hours later, he started moving and then regained consciousness. He was asking about his wife and baby, but hadn't been told yet that they died. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to [[Gretchen McKay]] until her death.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and Gretchen had three children and were expecting another. While he was in surgery, their fourth child was born and died at the hospital.
