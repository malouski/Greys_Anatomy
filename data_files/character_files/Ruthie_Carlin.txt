She originally planned to get a mechanical valve, but when she heard about the clicking noise it made, she reconsidered and thought she might want a porcine valve instead.\n\nAfter her sister ate a pork chop, she said that she didn't feel kinship with the pig and wondered if the bovine valve might be better. She asked if she could see the valves and make her decision that way. She said neither one was speaking to her, so Cristina said she just had to make a decision. She chose pig.\n\nIn surgery, there was unexpected bleeding, but Teddy told Cristina she could handle it and didn't step in to help. Cristina eventually made the decision of what to do. She was able to save Ruthie and finish the surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe has a sister. She also has a cousin whose wife is a cardiologist.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She's allergic to aspirin, ibuprofen, bananas, zucchini, squash, latex, and dust mites.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carlin, Ruthie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
