He tried to run up to the choir loft, presumably to warn his girlfriend, [[Astrid]], the choir director, but he fell down two flights of stairs and had to be taken to the hospital. In the ER, they did an ultrasound of his belly and then ordered a CT, which revealed bleeding near his kidney. [[Amelia Shepherd]] consulted and said he had a mild concussion, but she cleared him for surgery. They took him into surgery, where they removed part of his kidney.\n\nAfter his surgery, he was worried about the consequences of his sex tape being released, including his entire congregation turning their backs on him and his mother's friends refusing to talk to her. Someone even threatened to bring charges against him. [[Penelope Blake|Penny]] did a post-op exam and he started having severe pain in his stomach. She saw blood in his urine bag and diagnosed a clot in his catheter. She pushed heparin and had Meredith paged. When Meredith arrived, she took over and stabilized Robert.\n\nLater, Astrid came to see him, wanting him to know he had at least one person.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is dating a nice but adventurous woman named [[Astrid]]. They made a sex tape together, which he accidentally sent to the entire congregation of his church.\n\n===Professional===\nAfter his sex tape was accidentally sent to his congregation, they turned their backs on him, which shocked him because they were supposed to be a community.\n\n==Career==\nHe was the pastor at First Lutheran Church until he was fired when his sex tape was sent to his congregation accidentally.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Matthews, Robert}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
