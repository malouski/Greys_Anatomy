They were taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. She had a closed head injury.\n\nFrom the ER, she was taken to radiology for scans. There, it was discovered that she had a frontal lobe hemorrhage, which was repaired in surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, Ethan broke away from his social worker to find his parents, but when he found his mom, she didn't recognize him, scaring both of them. She was discovered to have a new hematoma in her temporal lobe. The blood pressure was causing symptoms of Capgras syndrome. They took her back into surgery to relieve the pressure. After surgery, she was stable, but unconscious. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\nThe day after surgery, Rachel woke up. She was again able to recognize her son and was relieved that he was okay.

However, while eating ice cream in the cafeteria with her son, she collapsed to the floor. Derek determined she had re-hemorrhaged and went to take her into surgery. However, before they could get to an OR, Rachel died. ''(\"[[Sleeping Monster]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to [[Paul Dawson]].
