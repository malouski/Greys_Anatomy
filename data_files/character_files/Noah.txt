[[Arizona Robbins]] did an ultrasound and a CT. She also started him on antibiotics for the sepsis. He was found to have a cyst on his liver, which ruptured when his mother hugged him really hard. Noah started coding, so they rushed him into surgery. The cyst was so large that they had to remove his gallbladder as well.\n\nHis surgery went well and his parents were told he'd be fine. It was possible he'd develop more cysts in the future, but at least they knew now.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis parents were concerned about him when he was in the hospital and worried about the possibility of another cyst rupturing in the future.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He likes to wrestle.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x17-1.jpg\n6x17-3.jpg\n6x17-12.jpg\n6x17-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
