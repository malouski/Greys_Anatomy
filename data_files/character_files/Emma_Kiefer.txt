Her parents were tested as potential matches for her and her brother, who had the same type of tumor, but only her father was a match, meaning that a choice had to be made to save one or the other. They were tested aggressively to see which of them was more likely to survive the transplant, but their statuses were roughly equal, complicating the decision. Alex Karev eventually decided that he needed to open both of them up and take a look directly at the tumors before he could make a decision. Once he did so, he decided that Emma would get the liver. Emma received the transplant and immediately started to improve while her brother died after an attempt at saving him by resecting the tumor.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe and her twin brother, Daniel, were both born with aggressive liver tumors. When she was determined to have a better chance for survival, she received a liver transplant from her father.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her apgar at birth was 6.\n*She was the older of the twins.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kiefer, Emma}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neonatal)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
