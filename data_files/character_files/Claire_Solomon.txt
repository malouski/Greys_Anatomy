They marked the rash to track the spread. It crossed the line within a few minutes of being marked, informing them that it was extremely aggressive. When asked about it, Wade, her husband, said she'd cut her foot on some oyster shells a few days ago while windsurfing in Puget Sound. They took her in to remove the infection, but the lab results showed that it was necrotizing fasciitis. They spoke to Wade and said that amputation was the safest option, but Sydney believed they could cut out the infection and try to keep the leg functional.\n\nSydney cut out every piece of necrotic tissue she could and said that she believed Claire would be okay after a few runs in a hyperbaric chamber.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is newly married to [[Wade Solomon]]. After their wedding, they planned an adventure honeymoon that included mountain climbing, windsurfing, and running a 10K.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Solomon, Claire}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ID)]]"}}}]}}}}
