He then developed a lesion in his brain which caused cortical blindness, meaning that his eyes were seeing, but only the subconscious part of his brain could process it, meaning that he couldn't read or see faces, but if a pen was tossed his way, he could grab it out of the air.\n\n[[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] developed a surgical plan which would involve removing a large portion of his tumor. The goal was to give him a few more years to live, but Drew was also hopeful that he would regain his sight. After the surgery, Amelia told Drew that she had removed about 98% of the tumor, which would give him at least a few more years, but he was scared to open his eyes to test if he was still blind. When he did open his eyes, he asked Amelia and [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] to speak so he knew which one was which. His vision was blurry, but he could see.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He called [[Stephanie Edwards|Stephanie]] \"Dr. Lavender\" because she uses lavender-scented shampoo.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hawkins, Drew}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
