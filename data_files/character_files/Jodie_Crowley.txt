She was taken to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to get treated. Her son, Tom, was with her and had to stay in the room with her because he's schizophrenic. He insisted that aliens had impregnated her. When the doctors examined her abdomen, they saw a pulsing. She said she'd had a mass in her abdomen for a while, but she hadn't gotten it checked out because she can't leave her son with anyone. When Tom fell down a flight of stairs while she was being examined, she was even more insistent that she couldn't have surgery. However, the doctors convinced her to have surgery by taking Tom in for his surgery at the same time, so they could have surgery together and go through recovery together.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHer ex-husband left when their son first got sick.\n\n===Familial===\nShe was the sole caregiver of her son, Tom, who had paranoid schizophrenia. She was adept at caring for him and had avoided her own care because there was no one else who could take care of Tom.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe said that friends had fallen away over the years.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 60 at the time of her car accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crowley, Jodie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
