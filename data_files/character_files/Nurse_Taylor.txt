Jo spent time running around the hospital, tracking down which nurse had tended to [[Frankie Baner]], so they'd know what kind of stroke he was having so they could treat him properly. She asked [[Nurse James|James]] and learned that [[Karen (Season 14)|Karen]] had been on shift at that time, but Karen said she was tied up, so she asked Taylor to take care of Frankie. Jo found Taylor just as he was leaving the hospital and he told her that he hadn't given Frankie Vitamin K, meaning giving him heparin would probably kill him. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\n===Roberta Gibbs===\nWhile [[Roberta Gibbs]] was being prepared for her liver transplant, Taylor came into the room to inform the doctors that the liver had been redirected to someone else. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n===Frankie's Death===\nWhen fellow nurse, [[Frankie]], was 28 weeks pregnant, she collapsed. Her spleen was twisted, but she refused surgery because she was worried about her baby. Her spleen started to un-twist, but then she had abdominal bleeding, so she was rushed into surgery. In surgery, the bleed was stopped, but then Frankie crashed, so they did an emergency c-section to deliver her son. After that, they tried to resuscitate her but they were unsuccessful. Richard then delivered the news of her death to Taylor and the other nurses.
