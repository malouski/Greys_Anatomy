Hubble''' came into the hospital with a bowel obstruction caused by swallowing 10 [[Judy Dolls|Judy doll]] heads.\n\n==History==\nMr. Hubble came into the hospital with a bowel obstruction. He wouldn't tell the doctors what he'd swallowed, so they believed it was drugs. They did an x-ray and saw what looked like ten drug balloons, but [[Alex Karev|Alex]] noticed that one of them had a face, so [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] deduced that they were Judy doll heads.\n\nThey took him into surgery, where they removed the doll heads one at a time. They consulted with psych about why he might have swallowed the doll heads. [[Raj Sen]] gave a few possible reasons, but when asked, Mr. Hubble didn't say why he had swallowed them. He eventually told Meredith it was probably better that she didn't know.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*A behind the scenes picture of the Judy dolls shows a label, stating his physician was Dr. B. Rosenbaum.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hubble, R.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}}}]}}}}
