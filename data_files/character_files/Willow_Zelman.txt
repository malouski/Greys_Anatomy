She was admitted to the hospital after being cut down out of the tree \"Kaili\" she lived in for six weeks.\n\n==History==\nWillow was in a tree that she was hoping to save from land developers. However, they bulldozed the tree with her in it. She fell and broke all her limbs and her cheekbone. They treated her fractures, but when she coded, she had to be rushed into the OR to treat a femoral bleed. After her surgery, she was awake and stable and her sister told her she'd filed a lawsuit for $10 million against the developers who knocked her out of the tree.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe and her sister don't get along well due to their conflicting beliefs about Willow's activism. However, when Willow was seriously injured when a developer knocked her out of a tree, Julie filed a lawsuit against the developers.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe had a friend who put food into a bucket each day for Willow and cleaned it after she pooped in it.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She lived in Kaili for six weeks.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zelman, Willow}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
