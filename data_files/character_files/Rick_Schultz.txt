While he was in rehab, his best friend, [[Jordan Carter]], threw a football at his face every time he acted like he was going to give up. This gave him the incentive to keep working.\n\n===Robotic Limb Trial===\nHe and Jordan entered the robotic limb trial together. They worked with the computer and competed with each other to see which of them would be the first to try walking on the leg. Jordan won and Rick cheered him on as he took a few slow steps. When Jordan fell and injured his head while trying to use stairs, Rick refused to go forward and try the limb himself, saying he wasn't going to take what was Jordan's. However, he later conceded and started taking steps of his own on the robotic limb.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nRick is very close with [[Jordan Carter]]. After his leg was amputated, Jordan encouraged him as he went through rehab. When they were both participating in [[Callie Torres|Callie Torres's]] robotic limb trial, the two of them competed to see which of them would be walking on the limb first. Jordan won, but ended up falling and hurting himself. Rick refused to try out the limb, saying that Jordan had won and he wasn't taking that from him.\n\n==Career==\nRick was in the US military. He was injured in combat and had to have his left leg amputated above the knee.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schultz, Rick}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
