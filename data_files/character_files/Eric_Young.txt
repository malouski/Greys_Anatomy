Eric had a hard time accepting that and believed Jackson and April were coming to save Brian's life. They went to Eric and told him Brian was gone and they wanted to talk to him about organ donation. He initially refused, but when Jackson talked about losing his own son and trying to find some meaning in it, Eric agreed to donate his organs. They wanted to retrieve his throat to transplant into [[Caroline Hodges]], but there was a lesion in his throat that made it ineligible for transplant.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe took his son, Brian, skiing for his tenth birthday. Brian loved it, but the day ended tragically when Brian was in an accident and later died.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Young, Eric}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
