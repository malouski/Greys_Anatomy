He had a broken leg and a head injury. His CT revealed that he had a subdural hematoma and a tracheal injury and also showed spinal stenosis, meaning he shouldn't have been driving.\n\nHis wife denied that Larry had any symptoms prior to the accident and was convinced that something had gone wrong with the car. She was told Larry needed surgery. While he was in surgery, his wife admitted that their daughter had taken away his keys and she'd given them back, not wanting him to feel betrayed.\n\nIn his surgery, Erica found a tear in his aorta while repairing his trachea. She called in Burke to help her and they were able to repair the damage and finish his surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Mrs. Dickerson]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe has one daughter, who took away his keys when spinal stenosis took away the feeling in his feet.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 86 at the time of his accident.\n*The accident killed two people and injured 14 more.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dickerson, Larry Shane}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
