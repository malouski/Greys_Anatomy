She is married to [[Carina DeLuca]].\n\n==History==\n===Early Life===\nMaya grew up with an abusive father, who pushed her to train excessively to ensure her winning every race, going as far as forcing her out of bed the morning after a race by pouring cold water over her rather than letting her enjoy her victory. He also put her on a strict diet that wouldn't even allow her to eat a cookie. As such, Maya missed out on the things that most teenagers occupy themselves with, like music and celebrity crushes.\n\nDuring practice, one of her competitors, [[Hima]], approached her and invited her to tag along with the rest of the team for pizza. Maya declined because of her diet. Hima had noticed him at races before and commented he was a bit scary. Maya admitted he was. Hima then invited her to the movies, which Maya accepted. As their friendship grew, Maya developed a crush on her. While Hima was helping her with her trigonometry, she discovered that Maya wouldn't even eat a cookie per her father's imposed diet. Maya knew how it looked but she praised herself lucky for having a dad who put her above everything else, never missing a single race, while other dads were always working or vanished after a divorce. Hima then found out Maya didn't know anything about pop culture. When she asked if Maya had a celebrity crush, Maya replied she had a crush, though not a celebrity one. She then leaned in and kissed Hima.\n\nDuring the next race, Hima twisted her ankle and fell on the track. Maya, who was leading the race, stopped to check on her. Hima urged her to keep going but Maya only managed to get back to second place. Her father was furious with her and told her she had no friends on the track, only competition. That night at the dinner table, he punished her by denying her potatoes. He then went on to ignore Maya completely and turned to Mason, who wasn't used to receiving attention from his father. Mason said he finished third in a mile run and got a piece in the school art show. Their father told him to quit art so he could achieve first place. Maya stood up for him by saying she would come to his art show and reached for the potatoes, but her father grabbed them and threw the bowl into the wall and he told Mason he couldn't hear losers, who are dead to him. His behavior made her put all her attention back into training. She won the next race and as her father congratulated her, she ignored Hima's attempt at high fiving her.<ref>[[Into the Woods]], 3x05 (S19)</ref>\n[[File:3x04MayaMedal.png|thumb|Maya's gold medal.]]\nMaya then went on to win a gold medal in the 10,000 meter sprint in the 2012 Olympics in London. She did so on a sprained ankle, pushing through the pain like she had been taught.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref><ref>[[House Where Nobody Lives]], 3x04 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Fire Academy===\nOn her first day at the fire academy, Maya met Andy. Andy tried to tell her they didn't have to be friends because they were the only two women. Maya said there's safety in numbers and they ended up sticking together. When Andy struggled with a hose drill, Maya coached her through it.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Working at Station 19 and Finding Her Brother===\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station 19 responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguished, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], 1x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do, but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], 1x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station 19 responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], 1x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], 1x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy was confused about her feelings, she called Maya and Vic to drink and hang out. They talked on the porch and admitted Ryan's looks when he came over to talk to Andy.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], 1x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], 1x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya went with Travis on a medical call. They tended to [[Edith]], who had fallen and dislocated her shoulder, something that had happened before. Maya was shocked that Edith refused pain medication. Travis saw her foot shaking and asked if she had seen a doctor for it, but she said she was fine. Travis told her she needed an adjustable bed and her grandson was supposed to get her one. She said that she hadn't told her grandson about it because she didn't want him to worry.<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital. When Ben later came to Vic and offered to help her, she denied any trouble, saying she was still a rookie and something like that could damage her reputation forever.<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhile on duty, Maya recieved a call from [[Ryan Tanner|Ryan]], explaining that her brother was in jail for stealing art supplies. When she arrived at the jail, she was surprised to find out that he was unhoused. She explained to Ryan how he took an interest in art but his parents had no attention or investment to give him since it was all put into her olympic training, and that Maya blamed herself for his drug addiction. Ryan said to her that he would keep Mason at the jail overnight and keep an extra eye on Mason while on patrol, which Maya agreed to.<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy responded to a call for an Aid Car at a police stakeout, just in case anyone got hurt. They got bored as they waited in the ambulance, unable to leave. After the lost the video feed and heart gunshots, Andy, worried for Ryan, wanted to go in immediately, but Maya reminded her that they had to wait to be called. Not long after, they were called in and they learned that it was another officer, not Ryan, who had been shot and they took him to the hospital for an x-ray because the bullet had been caught by his vest.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S19)|Shock to the System]], 1x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack and Andy were taking The Incinerator test, they left Travis in charge as he had seniority. He took his role very seriously. When they were called out to an intersection, they couldn't find the emergency. Suddenly, Vic noticed [[Piper]] calling out to them from here she was stuck in a pothole in the middle of a crosswalk. When a truck didn't notice her and was heading in her direction, Vic put herself between Piper and the truck and covered them. The truck swerved at the last minute and missed both of them. Travis was very cautious about making sure no one else fell in. They quickly discovered that the asphalt was digging into Piper's leg, keeping her trapped. They'd have to dig around her to free her. They dug for a while, but eventually, they had to pull Piper out when her leg started to swell. She was then taken to the hospital. At the end of the shift, Vic confessed to the others that she was scared of fire. They decided to help her without telling Jack and Andy, who would be obligated to report it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], 1x06 (S19)</ref> Maya and Travis did fire drills with Vic, exposing her to flames. Maya continued the drills, even when Vic started to panic. Maya tried to coach her through it, but Vic said it wasn't helping and stopped the drills. They later went jogging, which Vic also didn't enjoy, but Maya said it was jogging or the torches.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], 1x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya and Andy took an ambulance out to give hepatitis vaccines to unhoused people. They saw Mason, who declined a vaccine and Maya's help. Despite this, Maya returned to the area to bring Mason supplies, both things she thought he needed and things he thought he needed. When she jogged by the area later, she saw that he'd painted a mural on the wall, but had left the area.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], 1x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station 19 was called the respond. Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Maya noticed Vic just starting at the flames and stood with her when she said it helped.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], 1x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], 1x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station 23 arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], 1x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya was interviewed by Ripley to give input on who she thought should be captain of Station 19. Maya sang Andy's praises in her interview, including regarding her decision to leave Jack in the Aid Car with Peter. Maya also admitted, when pushed, that Jack overcame Andy's rule breaking to gain a good outcome. She then told Ripley she knew that Jack was a strong candidate. He then told her she was also a good captain candidate and he expected her to throw her hat in the ring to be lieutenant if a spot came up.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], 1x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. With the fire in the house, the garage started to heat up. They searched for anything they could use to try to free themselves. They found a toolkit, which Karen used to pick the lock on the trunk of the car and retrieve a jack. They tried to use the jack to lift the garage door, but it wouldn't budge. As the temperature climbed, Ryan decided to hot wire the car and try to use it as a battering ram. Jack said it was a bad idea, but Ryan started it anyway. Andy was able to stop him before he moved the car. Jack had the idea to use the motor from the internal door to get access to the house. It didn't work and they started to wear out. When Pruitt arrived and gave Andy a pep talk, she used the last of her energy to think of a plan. She saw the water heater and decided they could use the pilot light to create an explosion. They siphoned gas from the car and rigged the water heater up to explode and propel itself through the garage door. It worked and once they were free, they were all cooled down and rehydrated.<ref>[[Hot Box]], 1x09 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Skyscraper Fire and New Captain===\nStation 19 anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station 7 working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the law firm, Maya and Vic worked with [[Molly]], the fire coordinator for the floor who took her job very seriously. They had her watch the stairwell while they checked the floor. When the evacuation was started, they had to keep the civilians calm as they waited for their turns. They sent the first group down with Molly, but when the fire jumped floors through the windows, the civilians panicked and started running down the stairs, which led to them trampling Molly. Maya, who had intermittent hearing loss from the water heater explosion, didn't hear Vic warn her. Maya and Vic then continued to fight the fire and Vic found that she wasn't afraid anymore.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], 1x10 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya and Vic started to evacuate themselves, but they met up with Andy, who was on her way up to find Jack. Maya decided to stay with Andy so she wouldn't be alone and sent Vic down to find more help. She and Andy then went up to the floor where Jack was. The door was jammed, which Maya worried meant that the other side of the door was so hot it would kill them instantly. Despite this fear, she helped Andy open the door. Once the door was open, they heard Jack's PASS device going off. They followed the noise to a pile of rubble, which was burying Jack. They were able to free Jack and then evacuated the building.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 19's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station 23 had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety. Back at the station, Maya was upset with Andy for ruining their first chance to get Max.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], 2x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 was called to the apartment of [[Evelyn]] after her downstairs neighbors were worried about her after her floor started collapsing into their apartment and she didn't answer her phone. When they heard creaking behind her door, they broke the lock, which showed that there were stacks of things filling her apartment, which was compromising the floor. They heard Evelyn calling out for help, but weren't able to get in because forcing the door open more could cause them to fall and cause more damage. Sullivan sent Dean to get support beams and Travis and Vic to evacuate the floor below them just in case. Evelyn said she had fallen and was having a hard time catching her breath. She'd recently had heart surgery. Andy wanted to wait for the structural engineers, but Sullivan said one person needed to go in. He wanted Ben to go in, but asked for Maya's input. Maya suggested sending in Andy instead, because she's lighter and has more experience. When Andy reached Evelyn and gave a report on her status, Ben talked her through doing draining the blood around Evelyn's heart. Andy then put her on the stretcher and got her out. The floor started to crack more as Andy went to leave and Sullivan pulled her to safety as the floor collapsed beneath her. Andy was upset to know that if she'd had her way and they waited for the engineers, Evelyn would have died.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], 2x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], 2x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station 19 held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Maya was paired with Jack to teach one group, which included [[Elle Kingsley]]. They both flirted with her and spent the whole day trying to outdo each other for her affection. When Sullivan saw them laughing and felt they weren't taking it seriously, he called Maya out on it, which eventually got him sent home for the rest of the shift. At the end of the day, both Jack and Maya got Elle's number.Upon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party on the station's roof with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Lieutenant Application and Hooking Up with Jack===\nAt the recommendation of Ripley and Sullivan, Maya applied to be a lieutenant. She didn't tell the rest of the team, but they found out when Ripley commented on it in front of them. She later told Andy she hadn't told them because she worried about awakening the competitive beast inside her.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya was on the Aid Car with Andy. Their first call involved a kid. It should have been a simple call, but the kid ran into a building with a gas leak, so they had to track down the kid and break through a wall. They came back to the station very dirty. After a shower, they tended to [[Greg Tanner]], who came in looking for Pruitt to patch him up after a fight. Andy tended to him instead and called Ryan, who didn't believe Greg when Greg told him he got in the middle of a fight defending a kid and his phone got broken. When she was finished treating Greg, they got called out again, to tend to an injured hiker. With difficulty, they found [[Clark]], who had fallen and had a branch puncturing his leg. After returning from a later call, she and Maya found Greg in an elevator, where he'd passed out. They suspected a cardiac bruise from the fight. They were able to restore sinus rhythm.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], 2x06 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station. On their way to the call, a tree branch went through the windshield of one of the engines and a fallen tree blocked the road for the other. Ripley and Vic stayed behind to cut up the tree while Maya led the rest of the team to the emergency on foot. They arrived to find [[Jimmy (Weather the Storm)|Jimmy]] trapped in his car in a collapsed carport. They worked to open up the car enough to free him. Just as they were about to get him out, they noticed that the house, where his wife, mother, and twin newborns were, had caught on fire. Travis and Ben went into the house to evacuate the family. Travis easily found and removed Mary, but Ruth was in the nursery with both babies. Ben took them and told Ruth to follow him. He got out of the building and handed off the babies, but then realized Ruth hadn't come out with him. He went back after her, but got trapped until the engine finally arrived with more supplies and they were freed. The fire was then extinguished. It was then announced that Seattle Fire Department wasn't taking calls anymore and everyone should seek shelter immediately, so the team returned to the station and sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station 23.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], 2x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter noticing what was happening with Jack, Pruitt called out the rest of the team for not getting him help, knowing they'd all noticed that something was off about him. Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them, but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and called Maya up as lieutenant. They left to start the search. With difficulty, they found them and rescued them, but not before Shannon died. Four months later, Pruitt presented Andy with a Medal of Valor. They then had a party in her honor.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], 2x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nAndy, Dean, and Maya responded to a call about a woman injured in the park. They arrived to see a confused woman on a park bench with a head wound. She couldn't remember anything about herself or how she was injured. While checking her for other injuries, Maya found a picture of a boy in her shoe. They finished checking her out and then dropped her off at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Later, they found her at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] when they were dropping off another patient. Andy went after her and got her to agree to come back to their rig. Maya and Dean went to investigate how she'd ended up there. Dean learned she was a fugitive and the cops wanted them to distract her to give them time to arrive. They learned she was [[Margaret Chen]]. Andy felt there was more going on, so she asked Margaret about it. She stole some money from her work to pay for her son's medical care. She was going to put it all back, but she got caught before she could. He was scheduled for his surgery that day and she wanted to see him before her surgery. They enlisted Ryan's help. They were able to sneak her into the hospital to see her son and then she was arrested and taken to court.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], 2x09 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya and Jack were called out to the transit tunnel for an unknown medical emergency. They arrived to learn that a subway had malfunctioned and multiple passengers were injured in a minor fall. Once they boarded the car, they started treating the injuries, which all seemed minor. One of the injured was [[Will (Crazy Train)|Will]], who didn't want to let Maya check him out, but agreed when Maya asked directly. She examined him and asked about his cough, but his father didn't know how long he'd had it. Will coughed up blood and Maya noticed that he'd been on an international flight. He'd come from Bashran, in the middle east. Maya consulted with Jack and said she believed they were dealing with a contagious illness and needed to go on lockdown. They radioed out for CDC, which confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in Bashran and said they'd be on their way. They also noted that another passenger, [[Neil]], had come in on the same flight. They talked to Will's father and explained the situation and then made an announcement to the whole car. While they were working, Maya told Jack that she believed he had lied about being fine to get back to work. The situation escalated when Neil's condition worsened and he collapsed on the floor. They put in an IV and used lidocaine to restore sinus rhythm. He stabilized, but then Will collapsed. While Maya and Jack were distracted, [[Reese]] tried to leave, but [[Kenneth]], a security guard, used a taser on him, which set off a cardiac episode. He took the heart monitor off Neil and put it on Reese, which revealed ventricular arrhythmia. They didn't have anymore lidocaine to treat him, so Maya went through the Aid Car, asking the passengers to show her any medications they had. While she was working on that, Reese flatlined and Neil stopped breathing. Jack asked the passengers to help and handed out assignments. They were able to stabilize Reese, but realized Will needed blood. Desperate, Jack used Harold as a donor for his own son. After a rough moment, all the patients were stable. The CDC then arrived and set up decontamination so all the passengers could leave. Jack and Maya's tests showed that they weren't infected. After being decontaminated, the two of them went back to Maya's place and had sex in her shower.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], 2x10 (S19)</ref>\n\nOne day, an RV crashed into the side of station 19. Andy was surprised to see a young girl climb out of the driver's seat. [[Ellie (Baby Boom)|Ellie]] said her mother was shaking and wouldn't stop, so she tried to hit the brake, but hit the accelerator instead. Maya and Ben found her mother inside still seizing. Then they worked to expand the exit to get Ellie's mother out. They freed her, but struggled to get her to stop seizing. Once she was freed, they stopped her seizures and sent her to the hospital. When a broken cell phone and an extra propane tank caused an explosion, Maya took over caring for an infant that had been surrendered at the station so Sullivan could oversee stabilizing the building. She used him as a sounding board for her romantic and friendship troubles before handing him over to the social worker.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], 2x11 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Becoming Captain and Alienation===\n\n===Relationship with Carina===\n\n==Personality==\nMaya has an innate competitive nature that results in her wanting to be the best at the station. According to [[Dean Miller|Miller,]] she doesn't do relationships and usually only has exclusive relationships for a few weeks. However, Maya is also described as relentless and caring, and if she cares about someone she cares fully and will do anything for her friends and family.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], 2x13 (S19)</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Charlotte Dearborn]]====\nShe had a one-night stand with [[Charlotte Dearborn]] as part of her self-care.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], 1x10 (S19)</ref>\n\n====[[Elle Kingsley]]====\nWhile teaching CPR and first aid, Maya flirted with Elle, a police officer. At the end of the day, Maya got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref>\n\n====[[Jack Gibson]]====\nMaya and Jack first met on Maya and Andy's first day at Station 19. Jack\u00a0jokingly asked if he could touch Maya's Olympic Gold Medal for luck, but Maya immediately refused, telling him it wasn't luck but hard work and it proved how much better she was than him. Then, Maya and Andy both agreed that Jack was \"very ew\".<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref> Maya was the only person who knew about Jack and Andy's secret relationship, the latter's proposal, and their subsequent breakup. She was often antagonistic towards Jack, making smack talk about him behind his back and she had clearly sided with Andy during the captain's race.<ref>[[Stuck]], 1x01 (S19)</ref> However, when Andy and Jack got back together, Maya didn't know and was hurt when she found out, thinking Andy had betrayed her, but the girls resolved their differences.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S19)]], 1x05 (S19)</ref> Later, at the skyscraper, Maya helped Andy look for Jack.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter the skyscraper and the end of Andy and Jack's relationship, Maya and Jack were often seen bickering and throwing light-hearted insults at each other. When Ripley revealed that Maya had applied to be a lieutenant, Jack told her he was ready to take her on if she tried to take his job since there could only be two lieutenants at the station. At the police training, they worked together and competed for the attention of policewoman [[Elle Kingsley]], and eventually both got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref> When Pruitt drew everyone's attention to Jack's PTSD, Maya participated in the intervention. However, Jack got angry at everyone and told Maya she had no chance to take his job from him. When the team went to look for Herrera and Sullivan, Pruitt as acting captain benched Jack and ordered Maya to act as temporary lieutenant. Four months after the windstorm, Maya was meeting Jack after every therapy session and showing her support, telling him he would eventually return to active duty. She also invited him to Andy's party, but he declined.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], 2x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya and Jack were both on Aid Car during the next shift, but Maya didn't think that Jack was ready to be back to work. The two responded to the train crash which turned into an infectious disease call and even though they were arguing in the beginning, they later started working together to treat the patients. Afterwards, while waiting to be cleared, the two resolved their differences and later had sex while showering at Maya's apartment.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], 2x10 (S19)</ref> While Jack wanted to clear things up between them, Maya told him she was telling Andy about what had happened and that nothing would happen between them ever again. However, when Maya tried to tell Andy, they were interrupted by Ryan and his date.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], 2x11 (S19)</ref>\n\nLater, Maya noticed that Jack was doing the quiet thing, meaning he was angry and out of concern, she asked what happened. Jack told her that seeing Dean with his family brought up feelings about his own and he told Maya that he didn't actually know who his biological parents were. Maya tried helping him by suggesting he internet-stalk them, but he brushed her off and told her he didn't want her help. However, Maya still cared and she told him so on the rooftop of the station, adding that he was the last person she expected to care about. She then walked away, but turned around and kissed him passionately.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], 2x12 (S19)</ref> The two then continued to hook up in secret. While having beer for breakfast after shift at the houseboat, Miller asked Jack to point out why Maya would make a terrible fake girlfriend for him, but Jack simply complimented Maya, saying that \"her eyes sparkle even in the dark\", proving he also had feelings for her.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], 2x13 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy brought up the fact that she and Jack were on good terms, Jack went to Maya and told her they needed to tell Andy, but Maya suggested they have a last secret hookup in a supply closet before telling Andy the truth. However, Andy found them and she and Maya got into a big argument about it as Andy felt humiliated.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], 2x14 (S19)</ref> During overhaul at the coffee processing plant, Dean revealed that he knew about Maya and Jack as they often snuck in and out of the houseboat and Maya was eager to talk to someone about all of her feelings as Andy was still mad at her.<ref>[[Always Ready]], 2x15 (S19)</ref>\u00a0\n\nAfter Ripley died, Maya was visibly sad and constantly crying and Jack tried to ask her what was going on, but Maya denied the fact that she was crying. Later, Dean used an analogy with sea anemones to explain their behavior to them why Maya was crying and the fact that Jack wasn't actually annoyed with her as well as the fact that the two didn't know how to act now that they were officially together. At the funeral, Maya held Jack's hand during Sullivan's eulogy.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], 2x16 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter the bar crash, Maya sat down with Jack and told him he is good in bed and he is a good guy. He caught on to what Maya was intending. He asked if it was because she was interested in getting promoted to captain. She neglected to answer the question. She said they should just be friends.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], 3x01 (S19)</ref>\n\n====[[Nicole|Nikki]]====\nWhen Maya met Dean's girlfriend, Nikki, she was surprised that it was one of her exes.<ref>[[Into the Wildfire]], 2x17 (S19)</ref>\n\n====[[Carina DeLuca]]====\nCarina met Maya at the [[Emerald City Bar]] where she recognized Maya from when she brought in a patient's nose.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], 16x14</ref> Carina offered to buy her a drink if she told the story. Maya said she was drinking alone. Carina asked if she was sure, and Maya said she was maybe not sure.<ref>[[Into the Woods]], 3x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya called Carina when JJ went into labor at the fire station. They later FaceTimed, and Carina said they could talk about anything and any time Maya wanted.<ref>[[Ice Ice Baby]], 3x06 (S19)</ref>\n\nCarina came to the station and brought lasagna for Maya because she heard from Ben that Maya had had a rough day. Maya said that all they did was hook up and she didn't need a girlfriend. Carina went to leave but then Maya apologized. Carina closed the door and they started kissing.<ref>[[Satellite of Love]], 3x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter they had sex, Maya had a breakdown and said she was the truck that destroyed the family of Station 19. Carina comforted her.<ref>[[Born to Run]], 3x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nCarina told Maya to speak her truth in Italian, and then they started kissing.<ref>[[Poor Wandering One]], 3x09 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya asked Carina if she wanted to take some days off and go on vacation together. Carina gladly accepted.<ref>[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]], 3x10 (S19)</ref>\n\nOn vacation, Carina and Maya had drinks by the pool when a man named [[Todd (No Days Off)|Todd]] started to flirt with them. Carina commented that men are idiots in Italian. Todd thought she was speaking Spanish and tried to reply. Maya challenged him to a push-up battle and if she won, he would them drinks and leave them alone. He accepted the challenge and quickly lost. Maya ordered another round drinks on Todd's tab and Carina added french fries and mozzarella sticks. They then shared a kiss while the men looked at them in surprise.<ref>[[No Days Off]], 3x11 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya's phone chimed and she found out about the four-alarm fire back in Seattle. Carina assured her that everyone else would respond to the fire and that she couldn't help from 1,000 miles away. Maya started to have a panic attack about how she should be there helping. Carina told her that emergencies happen every day and that they all get fixed even without her. She held Maya's face and helped her calm down.<ref>[[No Days Off]], 3x11 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter Carina met Maya's mother, she went to comfort Maya because of her mother's statement that what her father did to them was abuse. Carina explained to her that she loved her own father so much it took her a long time to realize that what he did to them, letting them live in fear, wasn't okay. Although Maya kept saying that her father never hit her or her brother, meaning he wasn't abusive. Maya then decided she needed to go for a run to blow off some steam. After she came back, she saw that Carina never left. Carina said she stayed there in case Maya wanted to talk. Maya told her to leave and admitted that she slept with Jack just an hour before she got back.<ref>[[Bad Guy]], 3x15 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter an encounter with her father that led to her father grabbing her ponytail while she was working, Maya found Carina in line at the coffee cart and told Carina she was right. Her dad was abusive to her. She apologized to Carina and begged her to get back together. She said she loved Carina. She added that she'd never said that to anyone but her brother, so it was a big deal for her. [[Teddy Altman]], also in line at the coffee cart, encouraged Carina to forgive Maya. Carina said Maya slept with her ex-boyfriend, and did that to hurt Carina. Maya told her she was willing to spend the rest of her life trying to prove to Carina that Maya could be trusted. Teddy said Carina should forgive Maya if she truly loved her. Carina reluctantly told Maya she loved her too. They made up with a kiss.<ref>[[Louder Than a Bomb]], 3x16 (S19)</ref> \n\nOnce things settled down, Carina had to go back to Italy because of her expiring visa. Marriage was the only way to stop Carina from going back, so Maya suggested it. Carina stated she wanted kids but didn't want to get married. After a large fight, Carina left for the airport without Maya. In the car, her friend, Gabriella, called her and told her she should not let Maya go, as she'd seen how happy Maya made her, even while she was grieving her brother. As Maya and Andy were discussing the fight, Carina came running back from the car, stating that she would much rather do something she didn't want to do than lose Maya. Then, Carina proposed and Maya happily accepted.<ref>[[Comfortably Numb]], 4x13 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Familial===\nHer parents put lots of investment and attention towards her Olympic dreams, but they often put Maya and her training ahead of her brother, [[Mason Bishop|Mason]].<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Friendships===\n====[[Andy Herrera]]====\nMaya and Andy are best friends and each other's confidant.<ref>[[Stuck]], 1x01 (S19)</ref> They met at the fire academy and banded together as they were the only two women in their class and have been best friends ever since.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref> However, when Andy snapped at Maya that the Captain's race wasn't her fight, Maya backed off and was cold toward Andy.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], 1x04 (S19)</ref> She continued to ignore Andy, but after realizing you should let the people you love in, she went to find Andy, but was shocked to see Jack's uniform top outside the Captain's bedroom.<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref> While on a stakeout together, unable to leave, they started talking and sorted through their issues together.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S19)|Shock to the System]], 1x05 (S19)</ref>\u00a0While trapped in a burning garage with no way out, the two worked together to find a way to escape and Andy was worried when Maya was knocked over from the explosion.<ref>[[Hot Box]], 1x09 (S19)</ref> Maya also helped Andy look for Jack during the skyscraper fire.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\u00a0\n\nWhen Andy decided she needed to move out of her father's house, Maya supported her and offered to let Andy move in with her. However, later that day, when Andy jeopardized Maya's shot at rescuing [[Max Forrester|a kid]], Maya was angry at her.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], 2x02 (S19)</ref>\u00a0The two later resolved their differences and Andy often came into Maya's bathroom while Maya was showering to ask her for advice. When Ripley announced that Maya had applied for lieutenant and she would have an interview, Andy was upset Maya hadn't told her. Maya later confessed she hadn't told her because she didn't want her and Andy to get competitive, but Andy told her she wasn't afraid to get competitive with her. Later, when Sullivan took his anger out on Maya during the police training, Andy took Maya's side and yelled at Sullivan.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref> The next shift, Andy and Maya worked together on Aid Car and Maya was supportive of Andy who was worried Sullivan would fire her, but Sullivan didn't.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], 2x06 (S19)</ref>\nDuring the windstorm, Maya was initially rostered on Aid Car,\u00a0but Andy took her place along with Sullivan so Maya could impress Chief Ripley. When Ripley announced that Maya would be promoted to lieutenant at station 23, Maya tried to call Andy to tell her the news, but it went to voicemail.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], 2x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya was worried about Andy when Ripley told the team that she and Sullivan hadn't reached Rainier First Hospital and she drove the firetruck and helped rescue Andy and Sullivan. She attended Andy's Medal of Valor ceremony and later hosted a party at their apartment for the occasion. Maya also teased Andy about having sex with Ryan in her room during the party.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], 2x08 (S19)</ref> When Andy didn't want to give an interview about winning her Medal of Valor, Maya supported her, but told her that she'd lost her \"firegasm\" and the two worked together to help a woman with fake amnesia to see her son before his surgery. The two also agreed to have shower boundaries.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], 2x09 (S19)</ref> After Maya and Jack had sex for the first time, Maya wanted to tell Andy about it, but kept getting interrupted by Andy's own issues with Ryan and later decided to continue keeping her relationship a secret.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], 2x11 (S19)</ref> After agreeing to finally tell Andy the truth, Maya and Jack decided to secretly hookup one last time, but Andy found them in the supply closet. Andy slammed the door in anger and ignored Maya throughout the drive to the call, but made it clear that she was mad at her best friend. Later, Maya and Andy argued again and Andy said she felt humiliated that Maya didn't think enough of Andy to tell her she was seeing Andy's ex-boyfriend.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], 2x14 (S19)</ref>\u00a0\n\nAfter Chief Ripley died, Vic crashed with Andy and Maya and the two took care of her by making her breakfast and trying to reach her when she wasn't in her room despite the tension between them. Maya asked Andy if they should talk later, but Andy said they should just focus on Vic. Later at the funeral, Andy and Maya talked and Maya apologized for not telling Andy about Jack and Andy accepted her apology before Maya asked Andy how she was coping with the funeral. After the funeral, while at the bar, Andy and Maya talked about Andy and Jack and Vic. Andy then told Maya that Ryan had thought that she and Sullivan were together. Maya told Andy that she'd seen their moment at the hospital, too, but Andy refused to believe it.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], 2x16 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Professional===\n\n==Career==\nMaya is a firefighter at [[SFD Station 19|Station 19]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]]. When Sullivan assigned the team special skills, Maya got assigned incident operations.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], 2x04 (S19)</ref>\u00a0At Ripley's recommendation and Sullivan's insistence, Maya applied to be a lieutenant and was promoted shortly after.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], 2x03 (S19)</ref><ref>[[Weather the Storm]], 2x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen she was initially promoted to lieutenant, she was supposed to transfer to station 23. After the storm, with Jack benched, Maya acted as temporary second lieutenant.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], 2x08 (S19)</ref> However, when she was supposed to transfer, Sullivan asked Chief Ripley to let him have all three lieutenants, which meant that Maya remained at station 19 as a lieutenant.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], 2x09 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen Ripley died and Robert was promoted to Battalion Chief, Maya advocated for herself to be appointed Captain. She was granted the promotion, making her the youngest Captain ever in the Seattle Fire Department as well as the first female Captain at Station 19.<ref>[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]], 3x14 (S19)</ref>\n\nShe is a former Olympic athlete.
