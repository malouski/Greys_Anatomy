At the hospital, he believed he was dying and asked for a priest to talk to. When one wasn't available, he instead confessed to Ben that he knew the building wasn't sound and begged Ben to forgive him for killing all the people. He had been told there was damage after an earthquake, but he didn't have the money for the repairs. He couldn't raise rent because many of his tenants were barely able to pay him as it was.\n\nAfter confessing, he had a seizure and was sedated. He was taken for a CT and then into surgery. After surgery, he was taken to ICU, where he waited. [[Carolyn Adkins]], one of his tenants whose daughter, [[Winnie Adkins]], had died as a result of the collapse, came into his room and tried to kill him by disconnecting his vent. However, she was restrained and arrested before she could complete her attempt.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nHe has a good relationship with his tenants and has known many of the children since their parents brought them home from the hospital.\n\n==Career==\nHe is the landlord of an apartment building that collapsed.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Micah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
