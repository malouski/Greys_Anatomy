He said she looked good, which caused her to call him a liar. ''(\"[[No Man's Land]]\")''\n\n===Large Tumor===\nJeffrey did the CT on [[Annie Connors]] when she came into the hospital with a very large tumor. He wondered what would cause a person to wait and not get it checked out by a doctor. ''(\"[[If Tomorrow Never Comes]]\")''\n\n===[[Ellis Grey]]===\nJeffrey ran the biopsy samples from Ellis's liver mass and delivered the results to Meredith. ''(\"[[Make Me Lose Control]]\")''\n\n===[[Naomi Cline]]===\nJeffrey questioned Meredith when she ordered a second tox screen on Naomi Cline, but after she said Burke requested it, he ran the tests. The tox screen was negative again, but he also informed him that her serotonin levels were extremely high. ''(\"[[Tell Me Sweet Little Lies]]\")''\n\n===[[Melanie Reynolds]]===\nJeffrey did the CT on Melanie Reynolds after she was in a car accident. ''(\"[[Damage Case]]\")''\n\n===Lab Work===\nJeffrey scoffed when Cristina said she needed her lab results ASAP, saying everyone needs their lab results ASAP. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part 1]]\")''\n\n===Rebecca's Labs===\nWhen Rebecca came in saying she was pregnant, Izzie ran a pregnancy test. When it was negative, Izzie asked Jeffrey if he was sure it was right. He said it was. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n===Checking on Izzie===\nWhen Izzie showed [[Charles Percy]] where the lab was, Jeffery asked Izzie how her IL2 treatments were going. ''(\"[[Invasion]]\")''\n\n===Thatcher's Lab Results===\nJeffrey refused to give Lexie the results of [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher's]] labs. She threatened to report him to his supervisor, but he was unconcerned. ''(\"[[P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Ultrasound===\nWhen Meredith was pregnant with [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]], she had an ultrasound with Jeffrey, who determined that the baby was healthy and male. ''(\"[[Idle Hands]]\")''\n\n===Typing Gus's Blood===\nWhen [[Gus Carter]] reacted negatively to a blood transfusion, they went to Jeffrey to see if the blood hadn't been typed correctly. Jeffrey ran the typing again and it showed AB, like he said, but RH<sub>null</sub>, a very rare blood type variation. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\n===Casey's Disappearance===\nJeffrey was helping with CT and, while [[Casey Parker]] was having a CT, stepped out to prep the next patient and came back to discover that Casey had left. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\n===Testing Richard===\nWhen Andrew believed Richard had cobalt poisoning, Jeffrey tested his blood and told them his cobalt level was 200, much higher than the normal 8. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\n====[[Elizabeth Fallon]]====\nHe had a good relationship with Liz Fallon. When she was hospitalized after being diagnosed with cancer, he greeted her warmly in the hallway. ''(\"[[No Man's Land]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nJeffrey works at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] as a tech. He previously worked at both [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] and [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Jeffrey was credited as Radiology Tech #1, CT Tech, Lab Tech, CT Tech #2, Lab Guy and Tech.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n104RadiologyTech1.png|[[No Man's Land]]\n106CTTech.png|[[If Tomorrow Never Comes]]\n203LabTech.png|[[Make Me Lose Control]]\n214Jeffrey.png|[[Tell Me Sweet Little Lies]]\n224CTTech2.png|[[Damage Case]]\n311LabGuy.png|[[Six Days, Part 1]]\n413LabTech.png|[[Piece of My Heart]]\n6x05LabTech.png|[[Invasion]]\n7x14LabTech.png|[[P.Y.T.
