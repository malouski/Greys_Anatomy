She came into the hospital after being trampled when she seized during a marching band performance. She started seizing again as she arrived at the hospital. They had to shock her in the ER when they weren't certain she was in Vfib because of the seizure. Luckily, she survived and they ran tests to check for internal injuries. While observing her, Alex noticed that she had a cardiac episode right before seizing, leading him to suspect that the heart problem was causing the seizures instead of the other way around.\n\nThey did an EP study, which revealed ARVC. They put in a pacemaker, which would prevent any future seizures.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nTwo of Beth's bandmates, who were on \"seizure patrol,\" came to the hospital with her. They were resentful of her ruining their performance.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 17 at the time of her trampling.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dearborn, Beth}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
