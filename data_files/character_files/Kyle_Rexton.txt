Angered, Kyle pulled a knife on Jimmy and cut him. Soon afterward, Station 19 arrived and Jack and Andy were sent in to treat the injuries. When they realized the situation was ongoing, Andy called in Sullivan, knowing he would have special insight as a veteran. Jack then tried to talk Kyle down, offering him the extra money he needed to buy back his knife. While was considering it, Jimmy tackled him, sparking the situation again. Kyle then grabbed a grenade, pulled the pin, and threatened to blow them all up. Once Sullivan arrived, he was able to calm Kyle down enough to allow Jack and Andy to take Jimmy out to be treated, though he was unaware that Andy stayed inside the store.\n\nKyle and Sullivan then shared stories about the war, surviving explosions and the loss of their units. Kyle was frustrated because he couldn't get help promptly through the VA and he couldn't remember what he had for breakfast. He'd lost all his friends. He pointed out to Sullivan a pair of boots his friend Sara sold to that store so she could afford to pay her rent, and then she went on to complete suicide. Sullivan shared a story of a man from his unit who did the same thing because he couldn't cope with the guilt of accidentally causing the deaths of two others in the unit. He was angry about that as he felt that guy wasted the life he had and let the enemy claim another. Kyle told Sullivan that he just wanted the pain to stop. Sullivan took the time he was distracted to wrap his hands around Kyle's, holding the grenade in place. Kyle then tried to get Sullivan to leave, but Sullivan refused to leave a man behind. He gets Kyle to think of [[Ashley]], his girlfriend, so calm him down. Andy then revealed herself to them and said he needed to tell Ashley the truth and give her the chance to be there for him. Sullivan was then able to lead Kyle out of the store, where he was arrested by SWAT as the grenade was neutralized. ''(\"[[Poor Wandering One]]\")''\n\n===Hospitalization===\nA week after his arrest, Kyle was taken to the hospital with chest pain. Teddy examined him in the ER and talked about his history, which included PTSD after an explosion which killed his unit. He said he'd taken SSRIs in the past, but had to stop because he couldn't afford them anymore. He also reported memory loss. Teddy witnessed him having what looked like a complex partial seizure. She paged neurosurgery and Amelia did an MRI, which showed gliosis in his frontal lobe, which was causing the seizures. He was taken into surgery that day to operate and relieve his symptoms. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is dating [[Ashley]]. He tried to end things with her when he started having the seizures, feeling she shouldn't have to deal with that, but she came to the hospital anyway when she got the call that he was there.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe had a friend named Sara who completed suicide after her time at war. He also told Sullivan none of his friends were talking to him anymore. ''(\"[[Poor Wandering One]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe was in the United States Marine Corps. During his time, he served in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 36 at the time of his surgery.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nS193x09KyleRexton.png|[[Poor Wandering One]]\n16x18KyleRexton.png|[[Give a Little Bit]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS193x09-17.jpg\nS193x09-18.jpg\nS193x09-19.jpg\nS193x09-20.jpg\nS193x09-21.jpg\nS193x09-22.jpg\nS193x09-24.jpg\nS193x09-25.jpg\nS193x09-27.jpg\nS193x09-28.jpg\nS193x09-29.jpg\nS193x09-30.jpg\nS193x09-31.jpg\nS193x09-32.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Kyle Rexton Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rexton, Kyle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}}}]}}}}
