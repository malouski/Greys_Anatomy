An x-ray showed that none of the bones in his face were broken, so he was quickly discharged. After being released, he and his mother waited at the hospital to hear how Dave Buckley was doing. When Arthur and his mom learned that Buckley had been drunk at the time, they didn't believe it. His mother even spoke directly with Richard about him getting drunk after two sips of champagne at a wedding, which prompted Richard to diagnose him with auto-brewery syndrome. After Kevin was out of surgery, Arthur and Buckley visited him in his recovery room.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis mother says his father was an alcoholic, as was his grandfather.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Krug, Arthur}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
