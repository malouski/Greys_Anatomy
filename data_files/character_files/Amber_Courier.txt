The car flipped and she was pinned in it while it burned, burning half of her face. She'd been texting while driving. A portion of her hair was missing. She was in the hospital to have her hair restored. While they were examining her before taking her into surgery, they noticed that her fingers looked odd, so they took x-rays, which revealed that they were infected and three of them needed to be amputated, which meant postponing her hair restoration.\n\nAfter amputating her fingers, Mark said the infection looked isolated, so he decided to do the hair restoration was well.\n\nAmber liked the result, but the scar was longer than she thought it would be. She was told it would get better once it had healed more.\n\nShe confronted Trisha about saying her hand was just bumps and bruises, saying she sometimes calls in sick to work because she can't bear the thought of driving. Trisha then admitted her own struggles with her situation.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nAmber met [[Trisha]] in the burn unit. They'd been best friend ever since. They kept each other going by reminding each other that they survived. However, Amber confronted Trisha over saying that her fingers were just bumps and bruises, saying it was more than that. Trisha then revealed that she had been dealing with her own demons.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 28 at the time of her hair restoration.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Courier, Amber}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
