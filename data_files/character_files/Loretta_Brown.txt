In the ER, Nathan stabilized her. He and Maggie then decided to run more tests to determine if she needed surgery. She had a reduction of blood flow through one of her valves, so she needed a valve replacement. Nathan and Maggie disagreed on a treatment plan, but ultimately did a transaortic valve replacement, which was successful.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brown, Loretta}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
