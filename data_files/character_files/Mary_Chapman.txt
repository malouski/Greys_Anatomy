She brought him to the clinic for a drug test. [[Alex Karev]] said there were many other reasons that he could have those symptoms, but Hunter's mother asked [[Norman Shales]] to run a drug test, speaking to him as if he were the lead doctor because he was so much older than Alex. The drug screen was negative, so Alex suggested more tests. Hunter then had a bout of dysphasia, intending to say he wanted to go home, but actually speaking gibberish.\n\nHunter was taken for neuro exams and [[Derek Shepherd]] was called to consult. He had hydrocephalus pressing against Broca's area, which is why it affected his speech. They scheduled surgery to place a shunt.\n\nBefore he could have surgery, he collapsed in the clinic due to brain herniation. Derek instructed Alex on how to drain the blood to relieve the pressure. His mom was informed that after he had his surgery, the fluid would drain into his abdomen and he'd be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe brought her son to the clinic because she thought he was doing drugs.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x03-13.jpg\n4x03-18.jpg\n4x03-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chapman, Mary}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
