Jo spent time running around the hospital, tracking down which nurse had tended to [[Frankie Baner]], so they'd know what kind of stroke he was having so they could treat him properly. She asked James and learned that [[Karen (Season 14)|Karen]] had been on shift at that time, but Karen said she was tied up, so she asked [[Nurse Taylor|Taylor]] to take care of Frankie. Jo found Taylor just as he was leaving the hospital and he told her that he hadn't given Frankie Vitamin K, meaning giving him heparin would probably kill him. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nLater, James came to inform Richard that Meredith needed somebody else to assist her because [[Levi Schmitt]] had passed out in the OR. ''(\"[[1-800-799-7233]]\")''\n\n===Hyperbaric Chamber===\nWhen [[Gus Carter|Gus Carter's]] conditioned deteriorated to the point where he needed hyperbaric therapy to buy him time, James prepared the chamber for him and let Alex know when it was ready. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\n===Jamie Caldwell===\nWhen [[Jamie Caldwell]] had a biopsy for a mass in her back, James took the call from the lab that said they found no malignancy. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\n===Liver Transplant===\nJames was in the OR when [[Elisa Tang]] had her shunt placed and then had a liver transplant. He informed Meredith and Cormac when Seattle Pres said Andrew had left with the liver and then told them later there were no updates on his status. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\n===Talking to Amelia===\nJames came to tell Amelia that OR 3 was ready for her. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n===Taking Tom Back===\nWhen Tom decided to sneak out of his room to visit Meredith, desperate to be in a room where no one was dying, James finally discovered him and took him back to his own hospital room. ''(\"[[No Time for Despair]]\")''\n\n===Father Christopher===\nWhen [[Father Christopher]] was in the OR having surgery, James informed the doctors that his niece had arrived. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe is a nurse at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*James has been credited as Nurse and O.R.
