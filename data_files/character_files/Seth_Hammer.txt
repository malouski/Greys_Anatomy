He was upset because she thought she had stomach cancer because the internet told her so. When they found out the antibiotics she'd taken for a self-diagnosed staph infection had killed off all the good bacteria in her gut, they needed a fecal transplant to transfer in good bacteria. Seth refused to provide a sample until she would admit that the \"staph infection\" was actually a pimple. However, she was unable to do that and could only conceded that he believed it was a pimple. He ultimately agreed to provide the sample, but said it was better for their relationship that he stay in the lobby while they did the transplant.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Lauren Hammer]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hammer, Seth}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
