She was taken to the ER, where her injuries were evaluated. Despite being in critical condition, she tried to get up because she was told she was being suspended and possibly fired because she failed to follow orders. However, they were able to get her to stay. They put in a chest tube and took her to surgery.\n\nIn surgery, they found a part of a bullet and noted it was a devastator. Cristina found another bullet, but set it off, doing more damage to Gina's body. They repaired all the damage they could find, but her blood pressure was low, meaning she was bleeding from somewhere. They determined the uterine artery to be the cause and they were forced to perform a hysterectomy to save her life. She and her husband were told she'd be okay, but she wouldn't be able to carry any children. They decided she'd quit and they'd adopt Haitian orphans and start living their life together. However, she was then told that the review board cleared her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Jimmy Thompson]]. He said that she told him that as soon as she made lieutenant, they'd settle down and buy a house and start a family, but she kept getting in trouble right before the time came for promotion. When it looked like she was going to be fired, she agreed to quit and adopt kids, but once she was told the review board cleared her, she happily agreed to go back to work.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a police officer. Every time she got close to a promotion, she'd do something that set her back.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 34 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thompson, Gina}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Police Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
