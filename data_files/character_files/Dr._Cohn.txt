Dr. Cohn was at a dinner and they were told he'd be at the hospital within twenty minutes. Despite this, it took Dr. Cohn an hour and a half to arrive. When he got there, he scolded them for not getting a CT and paging him earlier. He then kicked [[Penelope Blake|Penny]] out of the room when she scolded him for not responding to his page in a timely manner. He operated on Derek's brain, but it was far too late and he was pronounced brain dead. Dr. Cohn apologized to [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]], saying that he had long admired Derek's skill and technique.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\n====Co-Workers====\nHe does not seem to have much respect for his fellow doctors, even kicking [[Penelope Blake|Penny]] out of the OR when she called him out for taking 90 minutes to respond to his page.\n\n====[[Derek Shepherd]]====\nHe told Meredith that he had long admired Derek's skill and technique, indicating professional respect.\n\n==Career==\nDr. Cohn is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] at [[Dillard Medical Center]]. He appears to be a typical arrogant neurosurgeon, passing the blame for Derek's condition off to [[Penelope Blake|Penny]] and [[Paul Castello|Paul]] for not getting a CT, despite him taking over an hour longer than he said he would to arrive at the hospital.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Cohn has a personalized beige scrub cap.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cohn, Dr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
