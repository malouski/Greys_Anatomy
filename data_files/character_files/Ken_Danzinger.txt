He denied drug use. His abdomen was rigid and his hair was falling out. They sedated him and his BP went down. Scans revealed a hemorrhaging liver mass. They informed the parents that his symptoms were consistent with the use of anabolic steroids. The parents confronted him and he admitted that he'd been doing steroids because he wanted girls to like him and he believes they only like guys with crazy bodies. He tried to claim that he'd barely taken any, but his mother said it had been two years, since his sophomore year, as that's when he'd stopped being her baby. They took him into the OR and biopsied the mass. Pathology confirmed that he had liver cancer, but they got it all when they resected the mass. His parents were warned that it could recur if he continued to do steroids. His father insisted that he wouldn't.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Dorie Danzinger]] and they have a son, [[Brian Danzinger]].\n\n===Familial===\nHis son, Brian, was hospitalized for symptoms of steroid use, including liver cancer.
