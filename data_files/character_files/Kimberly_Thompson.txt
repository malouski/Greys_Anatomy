During this time, she heavily bullied Maggie. In one instance, she put diapers at Maggie's work station, a reference to her being younger than her classmates.\n\n===Hospitalization===\nKimberly had a bicuspid aortic valve and thoracic aortic aneurysm. She had had a repair ten years prior, but the graft had weakened and she needed a new one. They did some scans and Maggie decided it was too risky. She went to Kiki to turn her down, but Kiki said that Maggie saving her life was her only shot not to go to hell when she dies. Meredith had the idea to thread the graft in from below, so Maggie agreed to do the surgery. The operation was a success. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\nLater, Maggie learned that Kiki had written an article about the experience, saying she'd had to stand up for herself in order to get the surgery to save her life. Maggie felt the article made it look like Maggie was the bad guy in the situation. ''(\"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nShe has no friends and no family because of her bullying. She spent medical school sabotaging other people's chances to better her own.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a family medicine practitioner. She has a small practice in North Dakota.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 43 years old at the time of her surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thompson, Kimberly}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
