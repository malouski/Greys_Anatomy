When Bailey took the stage, Matthew asked her about her having recently given birth and suggested she might be sleep-deprived. He also wondered why she lost track of her interns during that time.\n\nAfter the M&M, Matthew tried to tell Bailey it wasn't personal, but she said it seemed personal to her. Because of their conversation, she declined to hold a patient's baby, not wanting to appear soft.\n\nLater, Matthew saw Bailey holding a patient's son and asked her about it. She admitted to what she was doing and warned him to stay away because she was feeling a rush of hormones.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a doctor at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Savoy, Matthew}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
