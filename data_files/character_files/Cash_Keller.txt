They used a clothesline to play. The tugging motion led to Cash, [[Deedee Keller|Deedee]], and [[Jane Keller|Jane]] losing fingers. [[Frances Keller]] was also injured in the game when her hand was crushed.\n\nThe family went together to the ER, where the fingers were matched with their rightful owners. All the fingers were successfully re-attached and Frances was expected to regain full use of her hand after physical therapy. However, when Al tried to say that that it was good that they had family, his brother, [[Tony Keller|Tony]], punched him in the face, giving Al a nosebleed and possibly breaking Tony's hand.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nThough Cash initially blamed [[Gunnar]] for the finger amputations, [[Tony Keller|his Uncle Tony]] told him it was really the fault of [[Al Keller|Uncle Al]], who was the reason they were playing in the first place.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keller, Cash}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
