Despite this, his parents didn't seek medical care because their religion prohibits medical intervention. David and Marie were called to the hospital when Liam showed up there and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. They explained their beliefs and signed him out against medical advice to take him home.\n\nLater, Liam returned to the hospital. By the time his parents got to the hospital, Liam was already having the surgery. David threatened to sue, but Bailey stood by her doctors and said if they hadn't operated, they'd be having a different conversation because Liam would have died. Alex went to Marie and she more or less confirmed that she'd driven Liam to the hospital herself. David and Marie later prayed by Liam's bedside as he recovered from his surgery, which was successful.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[David Fisher]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband didn't seek medical care for their son, Liam, because of their religious beliefs.
