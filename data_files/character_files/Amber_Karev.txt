Her brother Aaron tried to kill her during a psychotic episode when she was sixteen. Aaron was then diagnosed as schizophrenic like their mother.\n\nAccording to her brother [[Aaron Karev|Aaron]], Amber is just as smart as their older brother [[Alex Karev|Alex]], and is more than capable of going to college.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n[[File:11x04-1.jpg|thumb|Nadia is sporting a Dutch braid like Amber did as a kid]]\n*It is likely that her surname was legally changed from Evans to Karev, her mother's maiden name, to disassociate from her father, [[James Evans]].\n*When she was younger, Alex dutch braided her hair.\n*She's the only member of the known Karev family not to have been introduced.\n*In Season 6's [[Sympathy for the Parents]] (which takes place in 2010), Aaron said Alex hasn't been home for seven years and that Amber was 10 when he last saw her. That makes her about 17 in that episode. In Season 7's [[Something's Gotta Give]], which also takes place in 2010, Alex stated that she was still only 16 years old.\n**It is possible Amber was yet to turn 17 in late 2010 when she was attacked by her brother Aaron, making her date of birth somewhere in late 1993 or early 1994. However, this would contradict Alex last seeing Amber at 10 if he left 7 years prior to [[Sympathy for the Parents]], as she would have only been 9. It is possible Aaron either made a rough estimation by the year he left, or Alex saw Amber sometime a year later, when not at home. \n*She has at least one child as of 2019 as Jo asked if Amber was having another baby.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], 15x16</ref>\n\n[[de:Amber Karev]]\n[[fr:Amber Karev]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Karev, Amber}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:Mentioned Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
