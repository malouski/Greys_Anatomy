They started touring the hospital, but that was derailed when a group of cops came into the ER after a bank robbery. Julie was fascinated by the sight, watching as the doctors started to tend to [[Brett Gibson]], who had been shot in the neck. She stopped watching only when she was led away.\n\nLater, while her class was looking at babies, she asked [[Arizona Robbins]] if the cop died. She knew that he was gurgling blood because he couldn't breathe.\n\nWhen her class went to leave, Julie left the group and found her way to an OR gallery, where she watched Brett's organ harvest surgery. When Derek found her, he told her she wasn't supposed to be in there, but sat with her and explained some medicine to her as they watched. She said that she wanted to become a doctor when she grows up. When her mother found her, she was happy to see her and gave her a hug.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nJulie's mother came along on her field trip to the hospital as a chaperone.
