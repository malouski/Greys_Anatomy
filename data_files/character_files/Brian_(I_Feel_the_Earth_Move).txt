Brian even waited three years to propose because of the conflict within their family.\n\n===Earthquake===\nIn an attempt to resolve the conflict within their family, Brian planned a ski trip for them. While they were riding the ski lift to the top of the hill, Brian with Micah and Karen with Danielle, the earthquake hit. Micah fell and Brian fell with him after trying to stop him. Brian had only minor injuries, but Micah broke his leg and had abdominal pain. Tests revealed that Brian's injuries required no further testing, but Micah was taken for a CT. The CT revealed a grade IV splenic laceration, so they planned surgery, but before he could be taken, he coded in the room. They were able to resuscitate him and get him to an OR, where they removed his spleen and repaired his other injuries.\n\nAfter surgery, Brian asked Meredith for information. He said Karen wasn't speaking to him at all, but he was worried about Micah, so he asked her just to nod or blink twice if Micah was okay. She nodded softly, much to his relief.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nBrian dated Karen for three years before proposing over the summer. He would have proposed after the third date, but their kids didn't get along. When Brian and Karen's son were hospitalized, he and Karen began to fight. By the time Micah got out of surgery, she wasn't speaking to him at all, leaving their relationship up in the air.\n\n===Familial===\nBrian has one daughter, Danielle. Danielle doesn't like her father's fianc\u00e9e, Karen, or her son, Micah.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 44 at the time of the earthquake.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Brian}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
