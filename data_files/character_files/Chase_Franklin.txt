In order for him to be able to eat and grow, they had to attach Foker knobs to his back and turn them each day to stretch his esophagus until the two pieces were close enough to be attached with surgery. He had to be put into a medically-induced coma for this process, meaning that his parents couldn't hold him at all, which was difficult for them.\n\nWhen the process was almost completed, Alex accidentally turned too hard and disconnected the knobs, which set them back a few days. They had to re-attached the device and continue bringing the pieces closer and closer. Eventually, they were able to take Lee into surgery and attached the two pieces of his esophagus together.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Kate Franklin]]. Together, they have a son, [[Lee Franklin]].\n\n===Familial===\nHis son, Lee, was born with esophageal atresia, which required a Foker process to close and surgery to reconnect.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Franklin, Chase}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
