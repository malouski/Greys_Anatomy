She asked Arizona to come down to talk to her, which she did. She was shocked to learn that Emily was only there for the baby and didn't wish to see Kristen, despite the fact that Kristen had the right to have her mom there while she labored. After the baby was born, Arizona updated her on the baby, saying she'd stay in the NICU until she was ready to go home. Emily decided to name her Hannah despite Kristen wanting to name her Ellie and said she wouldn't be bringing the baby to see Kristen. Arizona angrily asked her if she'd abandon this one too when she messes up.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer daughter, Kristen, is serving 20 to life in prison.
