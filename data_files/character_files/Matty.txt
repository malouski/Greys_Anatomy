However, Matty had had abdominal pain for a few days off and on and it got worse, so they went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with gallstones and an inflamed gallbladder. He was taken into surgery, which was supposed to be Stephanie's first start-to-finish surgery. The surgery was going well, but after she finished removing his gallbladder, he became tachycardic because of bleeding. She was unable to stop the bleeding, so Arizona stepped in and converted to an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed bleeding from the superior mesenteric artery from the trocar insertion. She tried to repair the tear, but she was unable to control the bleeding and Matty died in the OR.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nMatty and his parents were going on a cruise. Matty was excited and so was his father.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was nine years old at the time of his death.\n*He was the first child patient lost by [[Eliza Minnick]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x13-1.jpg\n13x13-8.jpg\n13x13-10.jpg\n13x13-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
