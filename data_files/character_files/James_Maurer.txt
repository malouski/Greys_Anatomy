She stepped in and her ear was injured. In the ER, April prepared to drain the blood from her ear, but was jostled and accidentally cut Sarah's ear lobe off and Andrew then slipped on it. Despite this, Jackson was able to take her into surgery to reattach it and told her in a few months, she'd barely notice the scar. Because she had to have surgery, she told them about her heart defect, a ventricular septal defect, which affected her ability to go under anesthesia. Maggie examined her and monitored her during surgery and also informed her that the procedure to fix the hole in her heart was much simpler and safer than when she was a kid. James, a malpractice lawyer, started gathering evidence for a lawsuit, but Sarah told him she didn't want to sue anyone, but she did want her heart fixed so she could finally stop sitting on the sidelines and instead play.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe's very protective of his daughter and didn't want her to play rugby because of her heart.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a malpractice attorney.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maurer, James}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
