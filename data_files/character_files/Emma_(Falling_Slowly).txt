The clinic staff believed she was an alcoholic despite her insistence that she wasn't. Alex was sent to treat her when she came in again. He tried to get her to accept that she was an alcoholic and that it would end up killing her if she didn't get help. He even brought Richard in to talk to her from the point of view of someone who'd been through it before. When she figured out what he was doing, she tried to leave the ER, but dislocated her shoulder. The doctors were shocked when she said it happened all the time and quickly reduced the dislocation herself. That, combined with her fainting spells, led Alex to believe she had Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. He sent Richard in to tell her. She was excited to have a diagnosis and the ability to get proper treatment.\n\n==Career==\nShe was rushed to get out of the clinic because she had to work soon and said her boss was a big jerk.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her good veins are in her left arm.\n*She is under 21 years old, but her specific age wasn't stated.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Emma}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
