The three of them were pulled from the water and taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Parker had a few small facial lacerations and a wrist injury, which required splinting, while Brooke had a perforation of her duodenum and was taken directly into surgery. While they were operating, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] thought of alternatives to why Brooke might have driven off the bridge other than just snapping under the pressure. She suggested an insulinoma, a tumor on the pancreas which would cause an extra secretion of insulin, which explained all her symptoms, including the low blood sugar she had in the ER. They did a trauma whipple to repair the other damage while pathology reviewed her scans, looking for the tumor. They came up with nothing, but Meredith was still convinced it was there, so she looked by hand. It was small, about the size of the head of a pin, but it was there. They removed it and in recovery, they told her husband that all her symptoms, the fatigue, irritability, and stress, were all due to the tumor and now that they had removed it, she'd make a full recovery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nParker lives with his parents and his sister, Mia. When his mother told them to shut up in the car and then drove off a bridge, it scared him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was five at the time of his hospitalization.\n*His father mentioned that violin and baseball are his kids' hobbies, but it's unknown which kid does what exactly.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:James, Parker}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
