She had a pseudoaneurysm along the suture line of her transplanted heart which made her heart useless. It had to be removed and she was put on a machine to keep her blood circulating. He stayed with her, even though he was supposed to be spending Thanksgiving with his family. Her condition continued to worsen and she had to have surgery under local anesthesia on Christmas day when part of her bowel died due to poor circulation. Because of the circumstance, they allowed Mike to come into the OR with her and they sang Christmas songs to keep her calm.\n\nFinally, on New Years Day, Kelsey got a heart transplant. Mike pulled out a ring and proposed to her, saying they'd been through a war together and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. She accepted.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe had been on four dates with [[Kelsey Simmons]] when she was hospitalized. Despite the length of their relationship, he stayed by her bedside. After she received a heart transplant, he proposed to her, saying they'd been through a war together and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. She accepted.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and Kelsey were supposed to spend Thanksgiving with his family, but instead, he stayed at the hospital with her.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Mike}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
