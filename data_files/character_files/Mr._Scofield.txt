They'd left it when it happened because it was safer to leave it in, but it had started hurting, so he came into the clinic to get a pain reliever. [[Izzie Stevens]] took some x-rays and located the bullet.\n\nBecause it had worked its way into scapula and gotten infected, they decided to remove the bullet. He asked them if he could see the bullet afterward, because he was convinced he'd been shot by one of his own men. They gave him the bullet, but they weren't able to read any identifying marks on it.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe mentioned that his wife didn't understand his anger of being shot by one of his own men.\n\n==Career==\nHe was in the US Army. While serving during the Korean War, he was shot in action. He believed he'd be shot by one of his own men who had a problem with a call he'd made, but he couldn't prove it without the bullet, which they'd left in his shoulder.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n3x18-6.jpg\n3x18-7.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scofield, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
