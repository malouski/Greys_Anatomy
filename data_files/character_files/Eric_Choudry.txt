One day, while they were walking, Madeline asked to let go of Rita\u2019s hand so she could run. She then slipped and hit her head, killing her. Rita always believed that her daughter died because she let go of her hand.\n\n===Rita\u2019s Pregnancy===\nRita had Ebstein\u2019s malformation, meaning that when she became pregnant after Madeline's death, maintaining the pregnancy was extremely risky. Eric begged her to terminate the pregnancy, but she was determined to continue. She was put on bed rest at the hospital because of her condition. When she was 33 weeks pregnant, she complained about upper back pain. Dr. Pierce diagnosed an aortic dissection. She was rushed into emergency surgery, where her baby was delivered and her dissection was repaired.\n\n===Baby Girl Choudry===\nRita and Eric\u2019s baby was diagnosed in utero with double inlet left ventricle, meaning she would require surgery immediately after birth. Because of her prematurity, her surgery was even more risky. [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Robbins]], after exhausting all other options, had the idea to split her one good ventricle into two. It was successful.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Rita Choudry]]. They had two children together.\n\n===Familial===\nHe had a daughter named Madeline who died in a freak accident when she was two. After Madeline\u2019s death, his wife became pregnant despite the risks and they had another daughter.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Choudry, Eric}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
