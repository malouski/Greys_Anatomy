His tibia was broken, so it was wrapped in the ER. While he waited, he and a couple teammates got in a fight, during which he tried to stand on his broken leg. His leg started swelling and became painful, so Owen examined him and found compartment syndrome, so he did a fasciotomy in the ER to relieve the pressure and then took Chris into surgery.\n\nChris was about to be put under for surgery and Owen explained that he caught the compartment syndrome in time for him not to lose the leg, but now they needed to stop the bleeding that caused it. Chris started panicking and rambled about things he hadn't said or done, thinking he was going to die. Owen told Chris to shut up so he could keep saving him and he was put under.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe has a girlfriend.\n\n===Familial===\nBefore his surgery, he worried about not having told his parents they were good parents.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duran, Chris}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
