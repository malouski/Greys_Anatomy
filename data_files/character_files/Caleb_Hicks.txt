He ended up a patient of Megan Hunt, who showed him her own abdominal transplant and suggested it as a possible treatment for him. Additionally, she called in Catherine Fox to see about his also receiving a penis and scrotum transplant. When he met her, he told her she was hailed as a hero on the message boards for those dealing with the loss of a penis. They went over his surgical plan as Meredith and Jackson went to retrieve the donor organs. He said that his mother had come into town to take care of him until his fianc\u00e9e, [[Anna Williams|Anna]], returned from her deployment. However, when Anna unexpectedly came in to his room, he demanded that she leave and told the doctors not to tell her anything about why he was there. With a lack of proper support system, Catherine called his surgery off over his objections. Desperate to find a solution, Owen took Caleb on a walk and they talked about the feelings that came from losing a penis and feeling the loss of manhood. Owen talked about breaking up with his fianc\u00e9e after returning from war, just as Caleb had done with Anna. After their talk, Caleb reunited with Anna and because he now had the support system he needed, the surgery went forward and the organs were transplanted successfully.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is engaged to [[Anna Williams]]. After he lost his penis and scrotum in an accident, he dumped her, but after Owen talked to him about his insecurities, they reunited.\n\n===Familial===\nHis mother came into town to help care for him after his surgery.\n\n==Career==\nHe is in the US Air Force.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 29 at the time of his transplants.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x20-2.jpg\n15x20-3.jpg\n15x20-5.jpg\n15x20-13.jpg\n15x20-15.jpg\n15x20-17.jpg\n15x20-19.jpg\n15x20-20.jpg\n15x20-21.jpg\n15x20-25.jpg\n15x20-26.jpg\n15x20-27.jpg\n15x20-28.jpg\n15x20-30.jpg\n15x20-31.jpg\n15x20-32.jpg\n15x20-33.jpg\n15x20-34.jpg\n15x20-36.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hicks, Caleb}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
