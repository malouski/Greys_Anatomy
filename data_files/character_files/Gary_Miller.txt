In the ER, April prepared to put in a crike, but Owen took the baby and did two quick back thrusts, which dislodged the coin, allowing her to start breathing again. Arizona and Amelia examined her because of her prolonged time without air and said she was breathing well and her neuro exam was clear, but they wanted to keep her for a few hours to observe her. She was moved to the PICU. ''(\"[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]]\")''\n\nLater, after the fire, Gary left the hospital to look for Erin, who was missing again.
