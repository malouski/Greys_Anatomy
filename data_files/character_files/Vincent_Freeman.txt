He also had pain in his abdomen, so Meredith ordered a CT and sent Jackson to suture the wound. When Meredith observed a gripping reflex that is usually only present in infants while attempting to discharge him, she ordered a CT and a neuro consult. The CT revealed a tumor, but Dr. Clemens, their neuro consult, said it was too far along to operate. Even when Derek offered to talk him through how to remove it, he decided instead to send Vincent out to another hospital.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nVincent's wife had left him two years prior to his hospitalization as she couldn't take him grabbing other women. It had been going on for a year at that point.\n\n===Familial===\nVincent had alienated a lot of his family, but his daughter, [[Donna Freeman|Donna]], stood by him, though she scolded him frequently for his behavior.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freeman, Vincent}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
