Owen quickly diagnosed and treated appendicitis, sending him home with oral antibiotics. Dave returned to the ER after he fell off a stepladder and broke his collarbone. He complained of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, as well as fever. Mabel, recognizing his predisposition to right-sided diverticulitis due to being Asian, ran a CT and shared her findings with Owen, who invited her to scrub in for catching the correct diagnosis. They took him into surgery, where they were unable to close due to the swelling in his colon. They put in an ileostomy and a temporary abdominal closure while they waited for the swelling to go down. Nico said his clavicle fracture wasn't displaced, meaning it would heal nicely on its own in about a month. His wife was later told that they should be able to close in a few days and then he could go home.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Dave Oyadomari]].\n\n==Career==\nShe works at Toyo with her husband.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oyadomari, Dave}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
