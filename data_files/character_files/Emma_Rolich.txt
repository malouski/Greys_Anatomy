[[Meredith Grey]], who delivered Emma, heard about Mary's tumor and passed the scans on to [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] to show to [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]].\n\n===Tumor Removal===\nWhen Derek saw the scans, he went to Clay and Mary and told them he believed he could remove Mary's tumor. Mary was excited and eager to have the surgery, but Clay resisted, saying that Emma needed the six months she had left with her mother and the surgery could take away those six months. After a conversation with Meredith, Clay came around and Mary had the surgery. Despite it being more difficult than Derek initially thought, he was able to proceed and the surgery was successful.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nEmma was conceived after her mother was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor.
