He was surprised as he hadn't known she was pregnant, despite her belief that it was obvious. When they arrived at the hospital, Niki was told she was five centimeters dilated. She explained that she'd gotten pregnant during a hookup, but decided to continue the pregnancy anyway, despite a lack of support from those around her. While she labored, Dustin decided to leave, saying he wasn't prepared to be a dad. Niki had some chest pain, but the EKG was normal, so they attributed the pain to anxiety. Niki then continued her labor alone. When she neared the birth, Niki grabbed Jo's hand and wouldn't let go, forcing her to page Carina. When Carina arrived, she reminded Jo of her role as a doctor. Jo then took over the delivery, which was complicated by shoulder dystocia. Despite this, she was able to deliver her son and held him after he was born.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe had been dating [[Dustin]], whom she met on a dating app, for four weeks when she gave birth. He left her in the hospital because he was unprepared to be a parent.\n\n===Familial===\nWhen she got pregnant from a hookup, her parents told her they wanted no part of it.\n\n===Friendships===\nHer friends thought she was crazy for having a random guy's baby.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Niki}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
