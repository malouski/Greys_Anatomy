She'd been to the hospital three times in the past eight years to have them removed, but they kept coming back. Teddy planned a more aggressive approach, which involved removing both her atria and with them, all the cancerous tissue, and replacing them with bovine pericardium. She'd previously been a patient of [[Preston Burke]] and recognized [[Cristina Yang]], who had worked on her at the time.\n\nHer husband, Paul, was concerned about the surgery, but they were both told it was likely her best chance as her heart got weaker with each surgery.\n\nThey had only four hours to do all the work on her heart before the tissue would start to die. They took her into surgery, but when a tray was knocked over, Cristina panicked and lay on the floor. They had to send for another piece of bovine pericardium in order to finish the surgery. The rest of the surgery went well.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Paul Cotler]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 51 at the time of her heart repair.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cotler, Linda}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
