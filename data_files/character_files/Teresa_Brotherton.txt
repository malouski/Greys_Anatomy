She was upset because she had fallen down the stairs while holding her and was worried she was seriously injured. She passed her baby over to the doctors. Shortly thereafter, she collapsed. She had no pulse. In the ER, [[Cristina Yang]] relieved a tension pneumothorax and then [[Erica Hahn]] took over and took Teresa for a CT. Teresa has multiple broken ribs and a hemothorax, so she was taken into surgery. She survived the surgery and then made it through the night.\n\nIn the morning, Lexie brought the baby in to see them, but Teresa's heart stopped and the baby was sent back while they got her heart started again. Her other lung was leaking, but they couldn't operate because her heart couldn't take the strain.\n\nKnowing she wouldn't make it another day without surgery, they put her on a heart-lung machine in her room so she could be transported to the OR for surgery. They found a hole in her remaining lung and patched it. They were hoping it would hold and that was the only tear. When they checked, they found another leak. They tried to repair the damage, but they were unable to and Teresa died in the OR.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to [[Sean Brotherton]] until her death.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and Sean adopted a baby girl. They didn't name her right away because they wanted to get to know her first. Teresa bonded with the baby right away, but Sean didn't. He briefly considered giving her back when it looked like his wife was going to die, but after she died, he decided to keep her and name her Keisha because that's what Teresa wanted to name her.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brotherton, Teresa}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
