While he was fasting in preparation for his surgery, Finley's water broke, a month before her due date. Their son, Jasper, was born that day, one month early. He was taken to the NICU, where he was said to be doing well. Elliott was taken into surgery. His valve replacement went well, but his heart didn't restart when they were finished like it should have. Teddy believed it was due to hibernating myocardium and said they just needed to give Elliott more time. They told Finley about this and she was upset that they couldn't tell her definitively that it would work. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nNot long afterward, Finley was waiting by Elliott's bedside when his heart started to beat again. Andrew weaned him off the ECMO and pacing wires and Finley thanked Andrew for his work.
