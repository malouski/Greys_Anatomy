Derek decided to try brain mapping to pinpoint the location where the seizures began, but to do that he needed her to seize. He asked [[George O'Malley|George]] and [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]], the interns on the case, to research ways to induce seizures. They spent the day with Gwen trying methods of making her seize, like putting a television screen right in front of her, making her drink lots of coffee, and playing an old arcade game.\n\nAfter George and Izzie started fighting, she had another seizure. Derek located the area of the brain where it was coming from and told her he could perform a craniotomy. However, she thanked him, but declined. She realized that the stress from work was causing her seizures and not the other way around. She said she would quit her job, but if she was wrong, Gwen would come back and let Derek do the surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\nBecause of her stressful job, she rarely had time for any relationships or friends.\n\n==Career==\nGwen was a divorce attorney and very invested in her work but she disliked her job as it was very stressful (and stopped her from eating donuts in case of a sugar high during a court case). Although she disliked her job, she was very good at it. She knew that [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] and Derek's sex life was bad and that the sex was bad because of other problems and knew that Izzie and George had feelings for each other.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Gwen discovered Oprah during her time off. Oprah is apparently famous in her world for not marrying her boyfriend.\n*She has used LSD in the past\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graber, Gwen}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
