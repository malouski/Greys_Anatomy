When Alex went with Jaylen's parents to tell her about the kidney, they found her kissing her boyfriend, [[Thelonious|Theo]].\n\nWhile Alex was reviewing the post-transplant meds she'd need to take afterward, she became upset upon hearing some of the potential side effects and locked herself in a bathroom. Alex went down to the dialysis area and took Theo's phone in order to text Jaylen. She came out to say she knew it was Alex texting, but she agreed to speak with him only if he'd come into the bathroom with her. She tried to get him to put off the transplant as she wasn't ready, but he talked her into accepting the transplant, saying she needs to take the good things when they're in front of her. She agreed and the transplant went on as scheduled.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Mr. Donovan]]. Together, they have a daughter, [[Jaylen Donovan]].\n\n===Familial===\nHer daughter, Jaylen, received dialysis for kidney failure for three years before a kidney became available for transplant.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Donovan, Mrs.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
