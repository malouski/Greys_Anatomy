While her parents were talking to Alex, she grabbed a syringe and threatened to stab herself in the chest. Alex talked her down, saying that he believed her when she said she wasn't crazy. He asked her to put the syringe down so he could run tests. She did and was restrained. However, because he had promised her, Alex wanted to run the tests. Her parents opposed it, saying she'd already had tests and been diagnosed. They agreed to let them run the tests. The scans showed nothing, but Alex wasn't convinced. He said he knows crazy and Hayley isn't crazy. He was given four hours to find another diagnosis, so he enlisted the help of [[Lexie Grey]] and her photographic memory to find the cause. After doing some research, he believed she had Superior Canal Dehiscence Syndrome. They verified the diagnosis and then took her into surgery. The surgery had a chance not to be successful, but it worked and Hayley was excited to be able to function normally.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe had a grandfather who was schizophrenic and had killed himself.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 16 at the time of her correct diagnosis.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x22-9.jpg\n6x22-10.jpg\n6x22-12.jpg\n6x22-14.jpg\n6x22-18.jpg\n6x22-19.jpg\n6x22-21.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:May, Hayley}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
