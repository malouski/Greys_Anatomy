Walling''' was one of the participants in the domino kidney transplant. He donated a kidney to [[Stan Mercer]].\n\n==History==\nP.J.'s father, Kurt, was in chronic renal failure. In order to get his father a kidney transplant, his father offered him $10,000 to join a domino kidney transplant. P.J. donated his kidney to [[Stan Mercer]] and Kurt received one from [[Lindsay Herman]]. P.J. was mostly concerned with having the surgery, taking the money, and leaving, but when his father had a seizure and delayed graft function after surgery, P.J. stayed by his bedside.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis relationship with his father, [[Kurt Walling]], is strained.
