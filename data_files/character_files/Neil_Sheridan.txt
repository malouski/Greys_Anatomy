He was on TPN after that, which caused his liver to fail, leaving him in need of a multi-organ transplant, including his small intestine, large intestine, stomach, pancreas, and liver. He twice had transplants not go through.\n\nWhen Richard came to him to said that there was a set of organs available for him, he was doubtful that it would go through and so didn't ask his family and friends to come to the hospital, because they had come to the two previous surgeries.\n\nThere was a snag in the transplant when a tumor was found on the donor liver. However, [[Richard Webber|Richard]] believed that the tumor was benign and wanted to biopsy it to confirm. [[Mark Sloan|Mark]], who was acting as chief for the day, denied the request. In defiance of the request, Richard resected the tumor anyway and the tumor was shown to be benign. After Richard explained the situation to Mark, he allowed the transplant to go on.\n\nNeil woke up post-op and was surprised not to see his loved ones there. [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] reminded him that he asked them not to come, but she suggested that they could call right now.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nNeil's family came to his first two transplants, both of which fell through. When a third came up, he didn't call them because he believed it would fall through like the others had. When his surgery was successful and he woke up without anyone there, he was disappointed and immediately called them to come see him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 62 at the time of his multi-organ transplant.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sheridan, Neil}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
