She was examined and appendicitis was confirmed. She was then admitted to peds in preparation for her surgery. Shortly after, the hospital was put on lockdown, so they were unable to leave the area. Ruby's appendix burst while they were locked down.\u00a0''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\nBecause they couldn't leave and she would die without surgery, they made the area as sterile as they could, gave Ruby an epidural, and [[Arizona Robbins]] removed her appendix. She was then transported to another hospital for recovery.
