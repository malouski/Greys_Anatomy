He'd been on a feeding tube for eight months. He was meant to have surgery that day to break his jaw and insert titanium hinges, but [[Ben Warren|Ben]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] didn't want to because his condition made it difficult to sedate him safely. [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] pressed them to operate sooner rather than later because Jason had an abscess in his mouth. He challenged Ben and Derek to come up with a solution to their problem. Their first proposal was a foam block, but it lacked the necessary flexibility in case of emergency. Then Derek came up with the idea to use a bean bag, so the surgery went on as planned.\n\nThe surgery was successful.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Jason Cooper]].\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Annie Cooper}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cooper, Annie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
