She knew she didn't have Covid, she said, because she hadn't gone anywhere or seen anyone. Jo told her in the ER that her abdominal pain was due to pregnancy, so she was moved into a room. Carina did an ultrasound, which showed an empty uterus, so they started looking for other causes for the positive pregnancy test. They did a CT, which showed a fetus growing near her liver. She was told she was about 26 weeks along. Carina asked her if she wanted the baby. When she said she did, they told her her baby would need to be delivered right away, as waiting carried the risk of catastrophic bleeding from her liver. They took her into surgery, where Carina did a C-section. Her baby, whom she named Luna, was intubated and then taken to the NICU. Val's liver started bleeding, forcing them to remove one of the lobes, putting Val at risk for liver failure, but stopping the bleeding. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nVal was still in the hospital after her partial liver resection. She had concerned labs, so Jo ordered a CT, which showed a pseudoaneurysm, which required surgery. Val was upset with having to see her daughter only on a phone screen, but Jo explained that neither of them was stable enough to visit the other. Val begged Jo to help make parenthood real for her. After Val's surgery, Jo suspected she might still end up needing a transplant since they'd had to remove so much of her liver. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nTwo days after her surgery, Val was severely jaundiced and septic. She struggled with not being able to see Luna, worried that she was scared and alone. She tried to convince Jo that she was healthy enough to go see Luna, but Jo knew she was lying. Jo ordered a CT and labs, which showed that her liver was failing, so she ordered liver dialysis. Despite this, Val later coded and was unable to be resuscitated. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is divorced. She and her ex-husband tried conceiving for eight years, including six rounds of IVF. He blamed her for every failed cycle, asking what she should have done differently. They grew to hate each other and so divorced. She then had a one-night stand with a man who rented their back room and became pregnant, leading her to understand that it was never her fault.\n\n===Familial===\nHer daughter, Luna, was born at 26 weeks' gestation after growing on her liver instead of in her uterus. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")'' Shortly after Luna's birth, Val contacted Newman and told him about her. He wished her luck, but signed over his parental rights, leaving Val as Luna's sole parent. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")'' After she died, [[Carmen Delgado]] became her legal guardian. Months later, after many hoops to jump through, Jo Wilson adopted her. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nShe worked in publishing.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She enjoyed raunchy romance novels.<ref>[[Fight the Power]], 17x05</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n17x03ValAshton.png|[[My Happy Ending]]\n17x05ValAshton.png|[[Fight the Power]]\n17x07ValAshton.png|[[Helplessly Hoping]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Val Ashton Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ashton, Val}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
