Lloyd and [[Tim (Get Up, Stand Up)|Tim]] from Kleiss Neuroscience were sent to Seattle to convince Derek to join their project. He declined their invitation outright, but was forced to stay and watch their full pitch. After the pitch, he still said he didn't have time for it. He also said their method wasn't going to work. They were too narrowly focused. While they were talking, he left the room and let them continue to talk about it. However, when the president himself later called, Derek was implored to accept and join the initiative. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n===Fight Over Sensors===\nOnce Derek joined the project and had been vetted by the White House, he did a video conference with Lloyd, who mentioned that the sensors would be proprietary to the project. Derek said he was still using the sensors for his work with Callie. Lloyd told him he'd have to stop. ''(\"[[Throwing it All Away]]\")''\n\nIn order to prevent Derek from taking the sensors away from their project, Callie hired a lawyer. She said he didn't have a right to sign away the sensors because of their project and threatened to sue him if he proceeded. The two of them together video conferenced with Lloyd and Derek said he wouldn't continue to work with them unless he could also continue to use the sensors with Callie. He said they'd figure out a way to share. ''(\"[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nLloyd is a represenative for Kleiss Neuroscience. He pitched to Derek about the brain mapping initiative that was vetted by the White House.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Appearances===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x12KleissNeuroscience1.png|[[Get Up, Stand Up (Grey's Anatomy)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\n10x15Lloyd.png|[[Throwing it All Away]]\n10x16Lloyd.png|[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x12-11.jpg\n10x12-18.jpg\n10x12-29.jpg\n10x12-30.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Lloyd Appearances}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
