She was taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where her burns were treated.\n\n===Treatment and Meeting Anne===\nA few weeks after she was admitted, another burn patient, [[Anne Chambers]] was admitted after being in a house fire. When Anne was being prepped for her first debridment, JJ shouted out words of advice.\n\nLater, Anne's nerves started to grow back, so the pain of her treatments intensified, so to get her through, JJ made jokes about how Jo was Snow White and they were dwarves, Burny and Screamy. They also dubbed [[Dan Pruitt|Dan]] Stumpy and the woman who was in the ER with Anne Bitchy. When Anne's husband, [[Lance Chambers|Lance]], got upset with them for joking and left the room, JJ dubbed him Scaredy.\n\nAt Christmas, Lance brought Anne a present and left her. JJ heard it happened and frantically called for a doctor because Anne was upset. Jo gave Anne something to calm her down and JJ said it was good because he wasn't good enough for her and now this is her fresh start and she proclaimed the day their first Christmas. They began to sing Christmas carols together.\n\nOn New Years Eve, JJ and Anne stayed up to watch the ball drop and then even later just to talk, so Anne told her she'd take the first pain session in the morning. However, when Jo went in to check on JJ, she found that she had died. Anne was devastated to hear that JJ had died.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nWhen [[Anne Chambers]] was put in the bed next to hers in the burn unit, they developed a strong friendship, starting with JJ giving Anne advice on dealing with the pain. When JJ died on New Years Day, Anne was devastated.\n\n==Career==\nShe was a volunteer firefighter.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
