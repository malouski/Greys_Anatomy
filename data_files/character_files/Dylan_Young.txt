While they were making plans, Hannah decided to pull her hand out and Meredith replaced it with her own hand. ''(\"[[It's the End of the World]]\")''\n\nThey developed a plan to get the bomb out so they could operate on James. Just as they were about to implement it, [[Richard Webber]] informed Dylan that they were over the main oxygen line for the hospital, so Dylan shared the news with Burke. They then had to move the gurney to another OR very slowly. Once they were ready to start, Meredith started to panic and tried to get everyone else to leave the OR, thinking they'd blow up. Dylan then helped Meredith calm her nerves. Once he calmed her down, and she was able to take the bomb out of the patient, she handed it to Dylan. On his way out the door, the bomb exploded, killing him. ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n===Posthumous History===\n====Meredith's Near-Death Experience====\nWhen Meredith \"died\" after a fall into [[Elliott Bay]], she woke up in \"the afterlife\" and saw Dylan and [[Denny Duquette, Jr.]]. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\nDylan wanted to tell it to Meredith straight, but Denny wanted to give her time, which caused them to bicker. They both repeatedly asked Meredith what had happened, becoming frustrated when she kept saying that she drowned. When she finally admitted that she'd stopped fighting to live, they worried she might be out of time. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nDylan was a leading member of the Seattle Police Department Bomb Squad until his death. He died in the act of performing his duties.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*In both seasons he appeared, Dylan appeared in the sixteenth and seventeenth episode of the season.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Appearances===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n216DylanYoung.png|[[It's the End of the World]]\n217DylanYoung.png|[[As We Know It]]\n316DylanYoung.png|[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\n317DylanYoung.png|[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Dylan Young Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Dylan Young]]\n[[fr:Dylan Young]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Young, Dylan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Police Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
