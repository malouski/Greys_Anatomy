His father was informed that he might be able to take Rhys home soon so he could wait at home for a heart transplant. Noah was nervous about taking Rhys home and taking care of him without the doctors and [[Laura Morgan|Laura]] around, but Laura assured him that it was a good thing and he and Rhys would be fine.\n\nHowever, later that day, Rhys developed congestive heart failure due to his shunt leaking. He was taken into the OR. While in the OR, Rhys's condition worsened to the point where when a heart became available, it was directed to him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married until his wife died in surgery. They had one son together, [[Rhys Rutstein]].\n\n===Familial===\nNoah stayed in the NICU with his son, Rhys, while they waited for a heart transplant to come through. When he was told Rhys might be released, he was nervous about being at home alone with Rhys. When Rhys received a heart transplant, he was worried that Rhys would reject the heart.\n\n===Friendships===\nWhile in the NICU with his son, Noah developed a friendship with [[Laura Morgan]], whose daughter, Samantha, was also in the hospital. They stayed with each other while the doctors reported on their children, saying it helped to have a second set of ears for all the medical jargon. When they saw [[Stephanie Edwards]] approaching after a call came in from UNOS while Rhys was in surgery, they automatically joined hands. Their relationship was tested when the heart, instead of going to Laura's daughter, went to Noah's son. When Laura saw Noah watching over his son after his heart transplant, she went over to reassure him that Rhys wouldn't reject the heart and placed her hand on top of his.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He found out his wife died in the surgical waiting area, so he hates being there.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rutstein, Noah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
