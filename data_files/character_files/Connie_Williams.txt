The cancer was more widespread than they'd hope, taking over 60% of her tongue. She needed a surgery to remove her tongue and reconstruct it with flesh from her leg, which would allow her to breathe and chew normally. She was concerned because she wouldn't be able to talk understandably after the surgery.\n\nRichard suggested a functional muscle transfer that would allow Connie to speak after her surgery. Very few surgeries of that type had been done before and it was risky.\n\nConnie was worried about not being able to speak after the surgery, so her best friends, Joanne and Elaine, encouraged her to say everything she wanted to say to them before the surgery, so she'd have the chance. She did so, but hurt her friends' feelings with what she said. She worried about it as she was being wheeled into surgery.\n\nAfter her surgery, which was successful, she was in recovery. Elaine and Joanne came into her room and started telling her all the things they had wanted to tell her for years. She clutched their hands in relief.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHer first husband put his hand on Joanne's ass every chance he got and her second husband spat when he talked and he was ugly. She thought he was handsome, but he was not.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe, [[Joanne]], and [[Elaine]] are best friends. They all love to talk.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Connie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
