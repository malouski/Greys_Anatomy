Alex referred him to a transgender support group, where he met [[Jess (The Face of Change)|Jess]].\n\nAt 18, Brian came back to the hospital after saving up for the last four years to have his breasts removed. Jess came to the hospital to support him. On the other hand, Mr. Weston was highly unsupportive and felt that Brian would change his mind.\n\nThe surgery went well. Jess talked to Mr. Weston afterward and admitted that she had sent the e-mail informing him about the surgery because she believed he should know. He offered her all the money he had on him to help out with their rent, but left without speaking to Brian.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe did not support Brian's decision to have his breasts removed. While talking to [[Jess (The Face of Change)|Jess]], he repeatedly misgendered his son.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n9x14-18.jpg\n9x14-19.jpg\n9x14-28.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weston, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
