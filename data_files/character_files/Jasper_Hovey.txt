They'd waited for over a year to find a match. Jasper asked to meet his donor, who'd been dead for about a week, but Callie said they wouldn't have much to talk about.\n\nGeorge, concerned that Jasper was beating up his body by pushing it beyond its limits, decided to show Jasper his donor, plus another guy who'd died after having liposuction. Jasper was shocked at how old the donor was, even after George pointed out the man was two years younger than he was. Jasper then backed out of his surgery and went home.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nHe has a very good relationship with his orthopedic surgeon, [[Callie Torres]]. She'd operated on him several times for injuries related to his highly active lifestyle.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 55 at the time of his planned ankle replacement.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hovey, Jasper}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
