When Dr. Karev did not show up on time for the first session of the examination, both Dr. Collier and his fellow examiner gave him a failing grade. When Dr. Karev finally arrived, Dr. Collier informed him that he would need to achieve a perfect score in the next two sessions in order to pass his boards.\n\nDr. Collier seemed quite impressed with Dr. Karev's performance during the second round of testing, but seemingly failed him due to a trick scenario that Dr. Karev initially assessed incorrectly. However, because of Dr. Karev's passionate outburst regarding patient care, Dr. Collier passed him.\n\nSoon after the board examinations, Dr. Collier reached out to [[Richard Webber|Dr. Richard Webber]] and informed him that Dr. Karev's outburst lead him to create an additional spot at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|his hospital's]] [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship program]]. Dr. Collier then formally made the offer to Dr. Karev and agreed to the additional amendments to Dr. Karev's contract.\n\nHowever, due to [[Flight|the plane crash]], Dr. Collier allowed Dr. Karev to delay his start date and ultimately accepted Dr. Karev's decision to stay at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n==Career==\nDr. Keith Collier is the [[Chief of Surgery]] and an [[attending]] [[Surgery|surgeon]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. He runs the one of the top [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|residency programs]]. Additionally, his hospital's [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship program]] is the best in the country.\n\nIn 2012, Dr. Collier served as a [[Board Certification#American Board of Surgery|board examiner]] in San Francisco, CA.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Dr. Collier created a [[Pediatric Surgery|pediatric surgical]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] for [[Alex Karev|Alex]], despite [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|his hospital]] having already picked its fellows.\n*Dr. Collier is good friends with [[Richard Webber]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Collier, Keith}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
