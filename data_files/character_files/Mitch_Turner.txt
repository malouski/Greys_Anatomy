Lexie gave him sumatriptan, which helped. His CT was negative, so he was discharged. However, shortly after he left the hospital, Meredith noticed that his discharge signature was wildly different from his admitting signature and surmised that he was having a stroke. She got him back to the hospital, where she handed him over to the stroke team and they took him to see if he was eligible for the clot-busting medicine.\n\nAfter his treatment, he was told his prognosis was good, but they wanted to keep him overnight for observation.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe had been dating [[Gia]] for two years. Their anniversary dinner was disrupted by his headache. After seeing that she was more concerned with missing their dinner and having to cancel their trip to Aspen than his health, Mitch dumped her in the hospital and took back her keys.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner, Mitch}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
