Cristina had Mark come look at it, but he said it was probably just dermatitis and ordered her to get cerave cream. Cristina came back and saw that Mrs. Borsokowski wasn't breathing and had her moved to the ER. They got her breathing again and ordered plasmapheresis and a skin biopsy. 60% of her skin had sloughed off.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nShe thought of Cristina as \"the mean one\" and didn't want her working on her case.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Borsokowski, Mrs.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Derm)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
