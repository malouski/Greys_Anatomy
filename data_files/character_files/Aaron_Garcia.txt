They needed to stabilize his fractured pelvis. While Leah explained the case to the newly-arrived Callie Torres, she and Arizona used a sheet to try to stabilize his pelvis. When it became clear that Leah wasn\u2019t pulling hard enough, Callie stepped in to take over and she and Arizona stabilized the pelvis and prepared him for surgery.\n\nArizona used the Pringle maneuver to control the bleeding in Aaron\u2019s abdomen.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Garcia, Aaron}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
