A pregnancy test was run and it was negative. She had an unknown mass in her abdomen, so she was taken into surgery. In surgery, it was discovered that it was a bezoar that formed due to her eating her own hair because of an anxiety disorder called trichotillomania.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nMrs. Lanz is very controlling of her daughter. When she found out her daughter had eaten her own hair, she tried to convince her daughter just to stop eating her hair rather than getting treated by a doctor.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She doesn't eat carbs.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lanz, Mrs.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
