Jack got out and tried to follow her, but she ran away without saying anything, leaving behind her stuffed bear. Jack saw her again at the homeless camp and she told him that they told her not to get help, but her brother was dying. She led them to [[Joey Phillips]], who was injured when he fell through a floor in an old warehouse while looking for a place for them to sleep because Sarah's always cold. They noted that his collarbone was fractured and he was altered. They prepared to take him to the hospital, but he objected, as did the other kids. Sarah said some of them were bio siblings and some were foster. They ran away when their foster dad got arrested and if the state found them, they'd be split up. Joey was keeping them together. They had to intubate Joey and then they took him to the hospital. Jack instructed the other kids how to get to Grey Sloan Memorial and told them to meet Joey there. They ran to the hospital alongside the ambulance and when they got there, they ran inside and sat together in the waiting room for news about Joey.

''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\nWhen Joey refused to do his physical therapy because he felt guilty for being safe and warm while he didn't know the same was true for his siblings, Bailey made some calls and arranged for them to come to the hospital to have pizza and play video games with him. They all assured Joey they were happy and safe in their new foster homes. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\n===Push-In===\nAs a surprise for Joey, Ben arranged for Sarah, Ernie, and Frank to come to the push-in for the new engine. He hadn't seen them in months, but knew Sarah and Frank were with a family outside the city. ''(\"[[Too Darn Hot]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer birth mother died. Afterward, she spent time in foster care. At some point, she ended up in a house with [[Joey Phillips]], [[Frank]], and [[Ernie (House Where Nobody Lives)|Ernie]]. When their foster father was arrested, they ran away together and started living on the streets. They were split up again when Joey was hospitalized and social services was called for the other three.\n\nAfter they were separate, Sarah ended up in a foster home where she had her own room with a purple bed.
