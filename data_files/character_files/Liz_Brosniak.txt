Arizona did an ultrasound and told Liz she looked like she was having contractions, which she was going to try to stop. While she was examining Liz, she noticed that her son, Noah, had an unnatural-sounding laugh. She asked Alex and Amelia to take a look at him. They took him for an MRI and while he was gone, Liz started to panic that she had missed something and started bleeding. She was rushed into the OR for a cervical cerclage. While Arizona worked, Liz explained that she had been with the baby's father, Mike, but she left him because he always referred to the baby as their baby but Noah as her son and she knew she'd have a husband, but her son wouldn't have a father. After she ended things, she cried every day, which she thinks might be the reason she didn't notice his laugh changing. After her cerclage, she learned that her son's tumor was too close to his brainstem and was inoperable, though Amelia and Alex believed the research they were doing for [[Kimmie Park]] might also work for Noah. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\nNoah later underwent the treatment and despite the difficulty, Noah woke up after his procedure and was awake and laughing normally at a video with his mother. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was seeing a man named Mike when she became pregnant for the second time. After realizing he'd never see Noah as his own son, she ended things with him. Afterward, she cried every day for months.\n\n===Familial===\nShe has a son, Noah, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, which caused seizures that were manifesting as robotic laughter.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x16LizBrosniak.png|[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\n14x18LizBrosniak.png|[[Hold Back the River]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x18-1.jpg\n14x18-3.jpg\n14x18-4.jpg\n14x18-11.jpg\n14x18-18.jpg\n14x18-19.jpg\n14x18-39.jpg\n14x18-41.jpg\n14x18-43.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Liz Brosniak Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brosniak, Liz}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
