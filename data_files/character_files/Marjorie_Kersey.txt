Her injuries were initially treated at a community health center in Spokane, but four days later, she was transferred to Grey Sloan Memorial due to persistent abdominal pain. When she talked about trying to make a time machine, they did a head CT in addition to an abdominal CT. The head CT didn't show anything abnormal, but the abdominal CT showed a fistula between her liver and duodenum. She also had an abscess in her chest, but Maggie said it could be treated easily during her surgery. They took her into surgery, but there was unexpected bleeding. They weren't able to stop the bleeding and she was pronounced dead in the OR.\n\n==Career==\nShe was an astronaut with NASA. After leaving NASA, she worked on creating a device to travel forward in time.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 66 at the time of her death.\n*She logged over 1000 hours in space as an astronaut.\n*She won the Fundamental Physics Prize twice.\n*[[Miranda Bailey]] was a fan of hers.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kersey, Marjorie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
