While checking out the injury, [[Callie Torres]] told her that she'd have her back to work as soon as she could, as Emily told her that going to culinary school is her dream and applications are due in a month.\n\nA week after the surgery to fix her arm, she was back in the ER with extreme pain. Callie couldn't find anything wrong, so she sent her home.\n\nA few weeks later, Emily was brought back into the ER after running her car through a guard rail and into a tree. Callie was horrified as she suspected that Emily had attempted suicide to deal with the pain. However, after Callie mentioned the case to [[Derek Shepherd]], he suspected that she had spinal epilepsy, which was causing seizures that manifested as shocks of pain to her arm. They operated to fix the problem and after surgery, she was left without the pain.\n\n==Career==\nShe dreamed of going to culinary school to become a chef.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gardner, Emily}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
