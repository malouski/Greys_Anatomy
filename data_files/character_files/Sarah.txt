Her car flipped and landed on its side. When Derek came to check on them, he found that Sarah was concerned for Winnie, who wasn't answering from the backseat. Derek looked and saw Winnie, who was uninjured, but wasn't speaking because she believed she was dead. He showed Winnie that she was not dead by checking her pulse and her mother was relieved. Derek left them briefly to check on the other car, which upset Sarah. He quickly returned, asking Sarah what she had in the back of her car. She said she had a first aid kit and Winnie's backpack, so he used a tire iron to break the back windshield and retrieved the first aid kit, which was much more substantial than his own. He then guided Winnie out the back window to safety. He sent Winnie away so that he could tend to her mom without worrying her. He broke Sarah's window and pulled her out. She had a dislocated hip, which he reduced after distracting her. He then kept watch over them until Charlie's dad's car exploded and guided rescue workers to their location.\n\nSarah and Winnie were taken to the ER at [[Dillard Medical Center]], where her injuries were given more attention.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nSarah was married until her husband died of a heart attack while fishing with their daughter, Winnie.\n\n===Familial===\nShe has one daughter, Winnie.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*The car she was driving in the accident was the first new car they ever owned.\n*She told Derek that she drives the road where the accident was often.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x21-10.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
