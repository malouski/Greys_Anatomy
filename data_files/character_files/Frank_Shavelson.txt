Richard wanted to operate immediately, but Frankie, worried about her baby, convinced him to wait and monitor her. A second ultrasound later revealed that she was doing better, but she later had fluid in her upper right quadrant, likely due to the splenic artery rupturing. She was rushed into surgery. They removed her spleen, but then she hemorrhaged and they couldn't stop the bleeding. Frank was delivered shortly before his mother was declared dead. He was taken to the NICU, where his mother's co-workers watched over him. ''(\"[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\")''\n\nHe continued his stay in the NICU and the nurses continued to watch over him.
