She waited four months to go to the hospital because she\u2019s afraid of hospitals. She repeatedly tried to leave when they mentioned needing to treat her.\n\nTo help with the anxiety, Meredith gave her a sleep mask and talked to her about Halloween. Marge told her that all the kids in her neighborhood have grown up, but it was always fun when Philip was a child. They took her to the OR as Meredith distracted her.\n\nWhile in surgery, Callie discovered that the maggots had helped minimize the infection.\n\nAfter surgery, they removed all unnecessary medical equipment, had her son bring some personal effects from her home, and put a sign on the door to make her more comfortable. Callie offered to stay with her, but Marge asked if she had kids to trick or treat with, saying Callie wouldn\u2019t want to miss that because you only get 10 good Halloweens before your kids start wanting to go off with their friends.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\n====[[Philip Walker]]====\nShe is close with her son, Philip, who convinced her to come into the hospital despite her fear. When he was a child, she made all his Halloween costumes for him.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walker, Marge}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
