When they found out that one of the babies was smaller than the other because she was conceived in the other uterus a full six weeks later, Greg realized that Noelle had slept with someone else when they were briefly broken up after she told him she was pregnant.\n\nGreg left in anger and Noelle went into labor and had to have a c-section to deliver their son in an attempt to stop labor on their daughter. It was successful and after being challenged on whether he was just involved or fully committed, Greg came back. He said their son was amazing and then asked how their daughter was.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is engaged to [[Noelle Lavatte]]. He used the [[Ham or Eggs?]] metaphor to say that he was fully committed to Noelle from the start. They had briefly broken up when she told him she was pregnant because he wanted to get married and gave her an ultimatum to which she said no. They later reconciled. Greg found out that Noelle had slept with someone else during that time and became pregnant in her other uterus when the doctors told her that her daughter was conceived six weeks after her son. Greg left after hearing the news, but returned when their son was born. George asked him if he was involved or committed, causing him to rethink things and make up with Noelle, asking how their daughter was doing.\n\n===Familial===\nGreg was excited to be a dad. Because she calmed down when he talked about sports, he concluded that his daughter liked sports. When he found out that his daughter wasn't his biological child, he briefly left, but came back and claimed her as his own along with his son.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He loves weddings and kids.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stanton, Greg}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
