Richard diagnosed appendicitis and handed the case to Andrew. When Andrew went to explain the surgery to her, she flirted with him. He initially shut down her advances, but when reminded that his attitude could help put her at ease, he agreed to look at her instagram. During her surgery, he found dead bowel, so he converted to an open procedure. Once she was open, he saw Menkel's diverticulum, so Andrew did an ileocecectomy. It was successful.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 24 years old at the time of her appendectomy.\n*She does CrossFit.\n*She has nearly 1 million Instagram followers.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Alicia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
