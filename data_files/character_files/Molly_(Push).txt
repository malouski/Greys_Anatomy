She thought he was just having an anxiety attack because she asked him to move in with her, but it turned out that his heart had drifted and was compressing his lung. She felt guilty for her assumption. Todd was taken into surgery to place implants to move his heart back into place. After his surgery, she was told he'd be okay, but she wondered if he'd even want to see her because of the way she'd accused him of wanting other women before his surgery. Teddy told her that thinking you like a guy more than he likes you can make you a little crazy.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is dating [[Todd Holmes]]. She asked him to move in with her, but he was reluctant because his parents got married really young and hated each other by the time he was born.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Molly}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
