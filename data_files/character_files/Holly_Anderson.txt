She was texting to tell ''John and the guys'' where to meet them.\n\nIn the [[Emergency Room|ER]], the two bickered. Holly didn't want to give the doctors her name for fear she'd get in trouble, but Emma gave their names and dialed their dad on her cell phone so the doctors could alert their parents.\n\n[[File:EmmaAnderson'sFamily.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Her parents and sister grieving.]]\n\n[[Sadie Harris|Sadie]] tried to comfort Holly by saying that her parents wouldn't get too angry, they'd just be happy she was safe, but then [[Alex Karev|Alex]] noticed something wrong with Holly's eyes and quickly wheeled her away to an [[Operating Room|O.R.]] and Emma screamed after them, \"Good, take her away. I hope you die!\" She was taken for a CT and began leaking brain matter through her nose. She was brought into surgery and died on the table of a carotid dissection and a stroke, which Dr. Dixon pointed out that she nor Dr. Shepherd could have foreseen and she was declared brain dead. When Emma and Holly's parents were brought in, Dr. Dixon suggested organ donation. Emma yelled at Dr. Dixon, so Meredith politely asked [[Virginia Dixon|Dixon]] to leave.\n\nLater, Meredith comforted Emma, telling her that no matter what happened, Holly loved her, and she loved Holly and that if roles were reversed, Holly would forgive her.\n\nHolly was taken back to surgery for her organs to be harvested by Dr. Dixon.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHolly's sister and parents were devastated when she died.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 16 at the time of her death.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n5x10-6.jpg\n5x10-7.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, Holly}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
