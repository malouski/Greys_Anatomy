Laura had been diagnosed in utero with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Addison had to insert a balloon into her airway to open it up and allow her lungs to develop properly. ''(\"[[The Name of the Game]]\")''\n\n===Neonatal Surgery===\nWhen Laura was born, she wasn't breathing. [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] and [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] took her into surgery and discovered Laura had jejunal atresia. After Addison performed a complicated surgery to fix the problem, Meredith informed Susan and Molly that Laura was now in recovery. ''(\"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\")''\n\nFour days after birth, she was still in the NICU. She had a barium enema for dilation of the bowels. Later, her abdomen became distended, so she was rushed into surgery, where a portion of her stomach had to be removed. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part 1]]\")''\n\nAfter her surgery, she was stable and recovering. Her bowels started working and she had her first diaper change.
