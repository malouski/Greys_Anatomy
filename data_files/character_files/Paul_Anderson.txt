Not wanting to accept this, the Andersons,\u00a0along\u00a0with\u00a0Richard and Larry, pressured Arizona into performing a risky surgery to prolong Wallace's life by only 2 months, which went against her better judgment.\u00a0Although he\u00a0survived the surgery, Wallace later\u00a0went into septic shock\u00a0and\u00a0died in the OR,\u00a0despite Arizona's best efforts to\u00a0save him.\n\nPaul was deeply saddened by\u00a0his son's death and accompanied\u00a0his wife\u00a0to view his body in the morgue. Although Arizona\u00a0could not save Wallace, Paul agreed that the hospital would still have the donation they proposed\u00a0because of Arizona, not Larry's \"ass kissing.\"\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Bethany Anderson]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe has one son, [[Wallace Anderson]]. He was determined to find a cure for his son, even convincing [[Arizona Robbins]] to operate on him when she knew he wasn't strong enough to survive it.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Paul's occupation was not specified. However, given his vast wealth, he\u00a0was most likely a successful businessman or inherited his fortune.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x08-2.jpg\n6x08-3.jpg\n6x08-22.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, Paul}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
