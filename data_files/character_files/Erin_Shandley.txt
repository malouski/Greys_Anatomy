She was upset that her father's meds were late.\n\nErin was later brought into the ER after someone threw a brick through her windshield. She had massive head trauma and there was brain matter on the scene, so she was pronounced brain dead. Because her father was waiting for a heart transplant, he was told he could do a directed donation of her heart to himself. He was reluctant, saying he couldn't live with himself if he did it. However, after speaking to [[George O'Malley]], who said that he believed it's what Erin would have wanted, Jack agreed and received her heart.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nErin was very protective of her father when he was in the hospital.\n\n==Career==\nShe worked with five year olds.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 34 at the time of her death.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x05-7.jpg\n4x05-10.jpg\n4x05-14.jpg\n4x05-15.jpg\n4x05-18.jpg\n4x05-20.jpg\n4x05-22.jpg\n4x05-27.jpg\n4x05-38.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shandley, Erin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
