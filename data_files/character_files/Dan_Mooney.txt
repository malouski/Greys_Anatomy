They treated several patients, but when a sandstorm came in, they were forced to move. He and Owen took [[Billy Linneman]] with them in the APC, but on their way, they hit an IED. Everyone but Owen and Dan died in the crash. Owen was mostly unharmed, but Dan had an injury to his arm and a laceration to his neck. Owen removed his wedding ring due to the swelling in his hand. Then he put a tourniquet on the arm to stop the bleeding. However, Dan then revealed the extent of his neck injury by removing his hand. The wound started spurting blood and Owen immediately pressed his hands to the area. Dan knew he was going to die and had Owen say a Hail Mary with him. He tried to order Owen to remove his hand and let him bleed out, but Owen refused. Later, Owen agreed and removed his hand. In seconds, Dan died. Shortly afterward, a helicopter arrived to rescue Owen.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to a woman named Lisa. When he was dying, he asked Owen to make sure Lisa got his wedding ring.\n\n==Career==\nHe was a colonel in the US Army when he died.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mooney, Dan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
