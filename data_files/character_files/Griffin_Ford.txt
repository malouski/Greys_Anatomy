''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\nAs bad press brewed and there was talk of criminal charges against him, Griffin went to Grey Sloan Memorial saying he believed there was a medical reason why he made that mistake and caused the rocket explosion. Tom got Meredith to run some tests, but when her other patient got a CT, she called in Jackson to take over. Jackson completed his tests and said there was nothing wrong with him and it seemed like he was just looking for an explanation where there wasn't one. Griffin then went to Tom and said he couldn't do all the good work he was working on if he were put in jail. He pressured Tom to lie and say something was wrong with him. After some thinking, Tom came back to him and said he had an aneurysm which could have affected his judgment and might require surgery. Tom said when they'd know whether or not he'd need surgery would depend on how large the check was.
