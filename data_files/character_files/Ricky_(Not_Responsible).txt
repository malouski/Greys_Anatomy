His girlfriend, [[Julia (Not Responsible)|Julia]], came to the hospital with him when he had his surgery. However, before his surgery, they found out that Julia also had cystic fibrosis, meaning that being around her was extremely dangerous for him. Teddy refused to do the transplant unless they agreed to break up. They did, but Lexie found Julia waiting outside the hospital and convinced Julia that slow, joint suicide was not romantic, prompting her to leave for real. Lexie then had to break the news to Ricky.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nRicky was seeing [[Julia (Not Responsible)|Julia]], who also had cystic fibrosis. Teddy forced them to break up in order to get his lungs. They said they did, but secretly planned to stay together until Lexie talked to Julia and told her there was nothing romantic about joint suicide.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Ricky}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
