Being Chinese and unable to speak English, she was unable to tell Izzie that she really wanted her to look at a friend, [[Ahn]], an undocumented immigrant, who had sustained an injury to the head.\n\nShe stayed in the ER long after her laceration was stitched up and when Izzie saw her at the entrance to the hospital, she followed her outside and treated Ahn. Before they left, Qing thanked Izzie.\n\n[[de:Qing Lu]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lu, Qing}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
