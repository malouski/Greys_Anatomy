For the surgery, Liz was designated Twin A and Annie Twin B, meaning that Liz was determined to be the stronger of the two. However, during the surgery, Liz developed a clot in her brain, switching their statuses. [[Derek Shepherd]] was unable to fix the damage caused by the clot and Liz was declared brain dead. After the surgery was completed, Annie made the difficult decision to withdraw care for Liz.\n\n==Personality==\nLiz is more assertive than her sister. When clients at their work were causing problems, Liz was the one to take charge and yell at them. Liz was also more enthusiastic about being separated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\n====Mother====\nAnnie and Liz's mother was opposed to separating them, saying it was too dangerous.\n\n====[[Annie Cooper (We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together)|Annie Cooper]]====\nLiz has an identical twin sister. They were conjoined until they had surgery as adults to be separated. Unfortunately, Liz did not survive the separation surgery.\n\n===Friendships===\n====[[Dr. Kenzie]]====\nLiz is very close with her childhood pediatrician, Dr. Kenzie, who accompanied her and her sister to the hospital for their surgery.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 25 at the time of her hospitalization and death.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cooper, Liz}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
