He and his friends kept daring each other to swallow fish out of the aquarium. Chuck ended up pulling out the largest fish, a bronze catfish, and swallowed it. It had spines which then lodged in his throat making it hard for him to breathe. His friend, [[Evan]], brought him to the hospital, but accidentally slammed his hand in the door on the way out, further injuring him. In the ER, they determined he'd need surgery to repair his hand and extract the fish. After his surgery, he was told his throat would be uncomfortable for a while, but he'd be okay. However, his fianc\u00e9e, [[Roxanne]], came to his hospital room and pointed out how stupid what he did was, as part of a series of stupid things. She ended their relationship and left.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was engaged to [[Roxanne]] until she ended their engagement because she said he was stupid.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe and [[Evan]] are friends.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thompson, Chuck}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
