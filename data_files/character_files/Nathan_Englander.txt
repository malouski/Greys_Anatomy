His parents took him to an after-hours clinic, where the break was misdiagnosed. He was sent home without any pain medication and was up all night. The morning after, his pediatrician sent his family to the ER, where they waited several hours for Nathan to be seen because he needed to be put under anesthesia to get a cast on his broken leg as well as one on the other leg to keep the break stable so it would heal properly. At 7 PM, he was finally taken into surgery to have his casts placed. He chose the color blue for his casts.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nNathan's parents both came to the ER with him. They were worried about his leg and upset with how long it took to get him care.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*His mother calls him Monkey.\n*His favorite color is blue.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n7x15-1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Englander, Nathan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
