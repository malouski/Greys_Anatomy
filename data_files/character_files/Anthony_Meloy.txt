He had an injured arm and road rash. He insisted that [[Dan Gates]] was driving like a madman, while Dan said that Anthony jumped in front of his car. Suspicious about the circumstances of the accident, [[George O'Malley]] wanted to get a psych consult, but [[Alex Karev]], who was running the ER, said to discharge him. After George put pressure on him, he agreed to get the consult, but when [[Kevin Fisher]] arrived in the ER to consult, Anthony wasn't in his bed anymore. While they were outside looking for him, they saw him jump out one of the upper windows onto a parked car. They rushed him back into the ER, where they put in chest tubes and rushed him into surgery to repair the damage.\n\n==Notes and trivia==\nHe was 32 at the time of his car accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Meloy, Anthony}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}}}]}}}}
