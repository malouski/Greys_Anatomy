The work-up showed nothing, but when Julian mentioned that she'd been dizzy, Teddy ordered a CT Angio and a neuro consult. The test results showed stenosis and an aneurysm, so she had surgery for both problems at once. She was stable and awake after her surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to a woman named Shirl for ten years. Shirl never believed that he and Lucille were just friends.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe and Lucille have been best friends for forty years. Because they valued their friendship so much, they never pursued romance, despite having strong feelings for each other.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
