They did a neuro exam and got a CT. The CT showed a small amount of blood in his ventricle, but Derek believed it would resolve itself, so he kept him for observation.\n\nDuring a later neuro check, he was altered, so Meredith believed he had acute hydrocephalus from a clot. They drilled a burr hole in his hospital room to relieve the pressure. Once they drained the blood, he stabilized and woke up.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis dad, [[Rick Beglight|Rick]] is very protective of him, while his other dad, [[Michael Beglight|Michael]] is more laid back.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 11 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He was playing first base when he was hit.\n*He once hid a raw egg in his sock drawer for a month and then smashed it into his teacher's grade book.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beglight, Shawn}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
