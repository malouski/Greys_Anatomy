He made a peanut butter and honey sandwich. And then he fell asleep. When he woke up, he said the bees must have caught the scent of the honey that dripped onto his groin area. However, it was later revealed that he stuck his penis into the hornets' nest as a means of sexual pleasure.\n\n===Hospitalization===\nWhen he came into the ER, he said that he hadn't been able to urinate since the previous day. Stephanie examined him and noticed that his penis was swollen. He told her it was due to a bug bite. When she questioned it, he said it was more of a bee sting. When she was still curious, he amended that it was multiple bee stings. He told her a story about how it happened that was later revealed to be false. She ordered IV Benadryl, a steroid, and a catheter so he could urinate and relieve pressure on his bladder.\n\nWhen she went to catheterize Mr. Samuels, Stephanie was unable to find access, so she consulted with [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]]. When Stephanie relayed his version of the events to Catherine Avery, she didn't buy it, immediately asking Mr. Samuels if he stuck his penis into the hornets' nest. He confirmed that he did and Catherine informed Stephanie that there's no access for a catheter and she needs to go directly into the bladder. She hopes they aren't too late. When Stephanie asks what happens if they're too late, Mr. Samuels notes that he doesn't feel like he has to pee anymore. Catherine says that's because his bladder has burst. Mr. Samuels starts screaming in agony and they take him to surgery. The surgery was successful, but he still needed skin grafts to repair the external damage.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Doris Samuels]]====\nHe is married to Doris Samuels, who loves him despite his unusual sexual appetite, stating that there are so many more interesting things to know about him.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Samuels, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
