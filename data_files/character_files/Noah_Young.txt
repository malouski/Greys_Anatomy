They were both taken to the hospital, where he had shortness of breath. Despite this, he insisted that he was fine and was primarily concerned with his son. He declined a chest x-ray, but then he coughed up blood, so Owen took him for a CT, which showed pulmonary fibrosis. When they went to talk to Noah about this, he said he knew and he'd gotten it from his time in the military, but the VA refused to help with it because they denied that it was connected to his service. Once his son was discharged, Noah signed an AMA form and left the hospital with his son. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nOwen did some research into the burn pits that caused Noah's condition and found no good research, only anecdotes. He continuously tried to contact Noah to talk to him about it more, but got no response, so he went to Noah's house to appeal to him directly. Noah agreed to tell Owen everything he knew. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nNoah and Owen attended a meeting for veterans, led by [[Roy Davis]], who was collecting stories to appeal directly to the government to get them to acknowledge the connection between the burn pits and the many soldiers getting sick. Roy was surprised to see Noah there, as Noah had always previously refused to attend. Owen started to explain the study he was developing when Roy coughed up blood and collapsed, so they called an ambulance to take him to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Since he was already dying, they knew any treatment would only be about prolonging his life. He decided to have the surgery anyway, hoping to get enough time to lobby congress. He survived the surgery, but coded in his room afterward and died. When Owen told Noah Roy had died, Noah became upset with Owen and said he was done helping him with his study. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to a woman named Heather.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have a son, Danny. When he learned he was dying of pulmonary fibrosis, he was desperate to spend as much time as he could with his son.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe was very close with [[Roy Davis]], whom he met when he was just a recruit.\n\n==Career==\nHe was in the US military. During his service, he did two tours in Afghanistan, one in Jordan, one in Djibouti, and two in Iraq. After leaving the military, he worked at a seafood plant, but lost that job because his pulmonary fibrosis made him too weak to do the work.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He's third generation Bassett Infantry.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n18x03NoahYoung.png|[[Hotter Than Hell]]\n18x04NoahYoung.png|[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Noah Young Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Young, Noah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
