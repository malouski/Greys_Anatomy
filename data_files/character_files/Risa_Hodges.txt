Risa and Mary fought against laryngectomy because they wanted to preserve her ability to speak. When a potential donor for a larynx became available at the hospital, Jackson and April flew to the hospital to perform the transplant. However, the donor was found to have a lesion in his throat, making him not eligible to donate his larynx.\n\nWhen Caroline's mothers learned about the transplant not happening, they called Baylor and asked to have Caroline discharged so they could take her for a new treatment. Mary asked Jackson to convince them to stay by telling them what he had. He lied and told them he had an idea and wanted the time to figure it out. They agreed to give him until their flight.\n\nLater, while talking to April, he had the idea to use Caroline's intestine and appendix to build her an organic larynx. Her parents liked the idea and quickly consented. Before surgery, Mary hugged Jackson and sent him all the love she could and told him to bring her daughter back alive.\n\nThe surgery went well and after Caroline woke up, she hesitantly said a few words and everyone celebrated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Mary Hodges]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe strongly advocated for her daughter to keep her voice after she was diagnosed with layrngeal cancer. She wanted the more radical but less safe throat transplant over the laryngectomy.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hodges, Risa}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
