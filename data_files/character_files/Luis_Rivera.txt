Because she'd been detained at the border with her mother, her father didn't know how long she'd been in pain and the detention center only gave her an antacid to treat her. She had an intestinal blockage, which they were unable to resolve with an enema. She was then taken into surgery, where they took a biopsy while they resolved her blockage. The biopsy diagnosed her with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Because her father was uninsured, but made too much money to qualify for Medicaid for Gabby, Meredith used [[Ellis Shepherd|her daughter's]] name and insurance on the paperwork to get it covered. When Richard found out about it, he was upset that she'd committed insurance fraud, but knew of a program that would kick in after 30 days if they could keep Gabby in the hospital the whole time, so they had to get creative about ways to justify her continuous time in the hospital. In the meantime, they encouraged Luis to go back to work to occupy his time and offered him a cot so he could sleep in Gabby's room with her. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nGabby's staging results came back and showed that it was only stage 2. After Bailey told them this, Catherine said the Foundation would cover her treatment and associated costs. She also shared her own experience with cancer and said they'd do whatever they could to make sure Gabby was okay. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Hearing===\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing to determine if she would lose her medical license, Luis was among those who testified on her behalf. He told the board of how his daughter was diagnosed with cancer and how Meredith used her own daughter's name so Gabby could get treatment. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to a woman named Daniella who is being detained at the border. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")'' He later told the board that Daniella had been deported back to Honduras. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n===Familial===\nHe had recently been reunited with his daughter after being separated when he came to the United States to get settled before sending for his wife and daughter.\n\n==Career==\nHe cleans office buildings to earn a living.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He and his family are from San Pedro Sula, Honduras.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n15x23LuisRivera.png|[[What I Did for Love]]\n15x25LuisRivera.png|[[Jump Into the Fog]]\n16x08LuisRivera.png|[[My Shot]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x25-27.jpg\n15x25-28.jpg\n15x25-30.jpg\n15x25-31.jpg\n16x08-23.jpg\n16x08-24.jpg\n16x08-28.jpg\n16x08-29.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Luis Rivera Appearances}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rivera, Luis}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
