They fell in love and married, welcoming two daughters into their lives. Edra gave up her job in order to care for their children so that Burke could continue leading the\u00a0[[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]].\n\nHowever, in 2014, Edra wanted to move closer to her parents who lived in Milan. Burke, realizing that it was his turn after Edra had given up so much for him, gave up his job and passed the hospital down to [[Cristina Yang]]. Although no canon information has been given about Burke and Edra afterward, it can be assumed that Edra and her family moved to Milan shortly after Burke transferred the practice to Cristina.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to Preston Burke. They have two children, Simone and Vivianna.\n\n===Familial===\nHer husband gave [[Klausman Institute for Medical Research]] to [[Cristina Yang]] to run so that he and Edra could move to Milan to be closer to Edra's parents.\n\n==Career==\nShe was a surgeon until she quit to care for her and Burke's children.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Although Edra no longer practices medicine, she is still a doctor, if in title only.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burke, Edra}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:Mentioned Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
