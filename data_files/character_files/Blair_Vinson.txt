The music was loud enough that they didn't hear the car approaching. After the crash, they were taking to the emergency room. Blair was conscious and talking while Tom was not. Blair got up out of her hospital bed in order to go call her mom, but she was ushered back when [[Arizona Robbins]] found her.\n\nThey put her on a fetal monitor and ordered more tests. She was told that her baby was fine and she was mostly concerned about her husband. She had a deep scalp laceration, which [[Amelia Shepherd]] came to evaluate. While that was happening, she spoke cordially to the doctors until she suddenly started seizing. Despite treatment with anti-convulsants, she continued to seize until they sedated her. The seizing stopped, but then she coded. Despite their best efforts, they were not able to resuscitate her and she was pronounced dead.\n\nHowever, after this, they continued CPR to keep her blood circulating while Arizona performed a c-section to deliver the still-viable fetus. Blair's baby, after some initial trouble initiating breathing, was stable.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to [[Tom Vinson]] until her death. They'd been together for eight years.\n\n===Familial===\nHer mother didn't approve of Tom being in a punk rock band. She believed exposure to the music was bad for the baby.\n\nShortly after she died, her healthy son was delivered.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was pronounced dead at 11:16 PM.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vinson, Blair}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
