She has an older brother, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]], and an older sister, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]].\n\n==History==\n===Conception and Birth===\nEllis was likely conceived the day before her father died, as her parents decided to have another baby on that day and then tried and did have one.\n\nAfter her father's funeral, her mother took her siblings and left Seattle for the duration of her pregnancy, leaving only a note that said, \"The kids and I are safe.\" for friends and family. Despite a placental abruption, which caused Meredith to bleed severely when her water broke, Ellis was delivered successfully in San Diego. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")'' \n\n===Return to Seattle===\nShortly after her birth, her mother and siblings returned to [[Seattle]]. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Attack===\nA few weeks after Meredith was attacked by a patient, Arizona and Alex brought Zola, Bailey, and Ellis in to see her. However, the three of them were too scared by her appearance and the visit was brief. After she had recovered, the family was happily reunited at home. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n===Thatcher's Death===\nWhen Thatcher died, he left presents for Ellis, Bailey, and Zola in his closet. Meredith took those present to her kids and told them about their grandpa. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n===Halloween===\nFor Halloween, she was a ballerina. Her mother got out of jail that day too late to go trick or treating with them, but in time to help them sort candy. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n===COVID-19 Pandemic===\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, she stayed home with her brother and sister, [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]], and her new cousin, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] while her Mom treated COVID patients at the hospital.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, Ellis attended her brother's birthday party that year where he stuck his face right in the cake and then licked the icing off his fingers and made a big production of it. This made Ellis, Zola, Meredith, Amelia, Link, and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] laugh, something no one had been doing for a while because of the pandemic and the new baby keeping everyone up all night. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nWhen Amelia realized she'd missed Link's birthday, she convinced the kids to watch a movie by saying it was Link's birthday wish, giving them some free time. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith was hospitalized with COVID-19, Ellis was eager to talk to her. They were able to talk over Amelia's phone on video chat. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nShortly after Andrew died, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis had a dance party in the backyard while the grieving adults supervised and tried to figure out how to tell the kids, who had loved Andrew. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n===Play Date===\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n===Visiting Mt. Rainier===\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n===Meredith Waking Up===\nBailey and Ellis stayed home with Maureen while Maggie took Zola to the hospital to see Meredith in the hopes it would help encourage her to wake up. While they were gone, Bailey and Ellis made a fort. When Link and Amelia returned, they asked to be let into the fort. Bailey and Ellis denied them entry without the password. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her pulmonary studies showed a remarkable improvement in her lung capacity and her labs came out clear, Meredith was discharged from the hospital. Instead of leaving to a fanfare, she had Jackson slip her out the back and drop her off at home, where her kids greeted her happily. Because she hadn't told anyone she was coming, the kids' welcome home poster was unfinished, but she appreciated it anyway and asked her kids to tell her everything that had happened while she was gone. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith tried to regain her strength after spending so much time in the hospital, she and Ellis tossed a ball back and forth in the backyard. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\n===Christmas===\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Maggie and Winston's Wedding===\nIn August 2020, Ellis attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. However, at the wedding, Maggie's father and Winston's grandmother opposed the wedding, wanting to wait until more people could attend, so the wedding was postponed. Ellis immediately asked if she could get cake and was delighted when Maggie said she could. In April 2021, a new wedding was planned and they all attended. Ellis walked down the aisle with her mother and siblings to spread flower petals at the start of the ceremony. During the reception Ellis, along with both of her siblings, held engagement rings for Link as he proposed to Amelia on the beach after the ceremony. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")'' \n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nEllis lives in Seattle with her mother and her two siblings. Her father died before she was born, likely the very day after she was conceived.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was named after her grandmother, [[Ellis Grey]].\n*According to her mother, she looks like her father, [[Derek Shepherd]],<ref>[[She's Leaving Home]], 11x22</ref> though others have said she looks like Meredith<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], 17x08</ref> and Teddy commented that she looks like her Aunt Amelia.<ref>[[Breathe]], 17x10</ref>\n*She's obsessed with hip hop.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], 15x11</ref>\n*She is quick to laughter and anger; is smart, pensive, and stubborn; hates pink and purple, but loves brown and green; and gets enraged at the idea of someone cutting down a tree.<ref>[[It's All Too Much]], 17x08</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x22EllisShepherd.png|[[She's Leaving Home]] (with Meredith)\n11x23ZolaGreyShepherd.jpg|[[Time Stops]] (center)\n12x09EllisShepherd.png|[[The Sound of Silence]] (center)\n12x20EllisShepherd.png|[[Trigger Happy]]\n12x21EllisShepherd.png|[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]]\n13x21EllisShepherd.png|[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\n14x13EllisShepherd.png|[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\n14x19EllisShepherd.png|[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\n14x23EllisShepherd.png|[[Cold as Ice]]\n15x03EllisShepherd.png|[[Gut Feeling]]\n15x04EllisShepherd.png|[[Momma Knows Best]]\n15x05EllisShepherd.png|[[Everyday Angel]]\n15x06EllisShepherd.png|[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\n15x07EllisShepherd.png|[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\n15x11EllisShepherd.png|[[The Winner Takes It All]]\n15x22EllisShepherd.png|[[Head Over High Heels]]\n15x23EllisShepherd.png|[[What I Did for Love]]\n15x25EllisShepherd.png|[[Jump Into the Fog]]\n16x05EllisShepherd.png|[[Breathe Again]]\n16x06EllisShepherd.png|[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\n17x03EllisShepherd.png|[[My Happy Ending]]\n17x08EllisShepherd.png|[[It's All Too Much]]\n17x10EllisShepherd.png|[[Breathe]]\n17x11EllisShepherd.png|[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\n17x13EllisShepherd.png|[[Good as Hell]]\n17x15EllisShepherd.png|[[Tradition]]\n17x16EllisShepherd.png|[[I'm Still Standing]]\n17x17EllisShepherd.png|[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\">\n11x22-25.jpg\n11x22-26.jpg\n11x22-27.jpg\n11x22-28.jpg\n11x22-29.jpg\n15x05-13.jpg\n17x17-41.jpg\n17x17-42.jpg\n17x17-43.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Ellis Shepherd Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Ellis Shepherd]]\n[[fr:Ellis Shepherd]]\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shepherd, Ellis}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
