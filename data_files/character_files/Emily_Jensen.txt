She and her husband, Corey, consulted with [[Nicole Herman]] about their options for fetal surgery. However, before anything could be done, the fetus began to bleed into the tumor, causing anemia when Emily was 28 weeks pregnant. [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]], who was rounding on Emily in Herman's absence, informed Emily and Corey that Herman would likely perform an intrauterine transfusion, which would combat the anemia, which would allow them to make it closer to term.\n\nHowever, when Herman didn't answer any of her calls, Arizona had to make the decision to perform a c-section and allow Alex to remove the tumor, which would resolve the anemia. After delivering the baby, Arizona decided to go with the baby and Alex, leaving [[Graham Maddox]] to remove Emily's placenta and close. She was quickly paged back when attempting to remove the placenta caused massive bleeding. Arizona jumped in, saying it was placenta percreta and the placenta had invaded other organs. She paged [[April Kepner]], who scrubbed in with her to attempt to save Emily, but they were unable to keep up with blood loss and Emily was pronounced dead in the OR.\n\nAfter the surgery, Herman explained to Corey that Arizona had made all the right calls and that if she had done the transfusion as planned, he could have lost both Emily and the baby. Placenta percreta is very difficult to detect.\n\nThe baby, despite being premature, was doing well in the NICU after surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nEmily was married to [[Corey Jensen]] until her death. They have one daughter together.\n\n===Familial===\nEmily's baby was diagnosed in utero with a tumor. A complication necessitated the premature delivery of the baby and Emily died during the c-section.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She stayed in room 4120.\n*She was pronounced dead at 6:22 PM.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jensen, Emily}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]"}}}]}}}}
