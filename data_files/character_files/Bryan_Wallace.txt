He purchased a baby hat for his expected daughter, his first purchase for her. While he was at the store, he got a message that his wife, Mindy, was in labor. He rushed to the hospital, but on the way, he ran into the car carrying his wife. He had only minor lacerations while Mindy was in critical condition. His cuts were stitched up and he was taken into the OR for the delivery of his daughter before his wife had surgery. Despite Arizona warning him not to tell Mindy that he'd been the one to hit her, he confessed what had happened when Mindy noticed the scratches on her husband. He witnessed his daughter's birth, but Mindy became unstable shortly after she was born and the baby was cyanotic and had to be taken to the NICU.\n\nBryan was later told that his wife's surgery was finished, but she was still in critical condition. He was then taken to his daughter's bedside, where he was told that her surgery, to repair a diaphragmatic hernia, had gone well and she'd be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Mindy Wallace]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have a daughter.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He gets squeamish.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wallace, Bryan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
