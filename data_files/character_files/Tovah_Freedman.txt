She was the youngest of five siblings, but was always the mother when they played.\n\nWhen she grew up, she married Jonathan and they immediately tried to have children. She had her first miscarriage six months into their marriage and had one per year until they finally got to the second trimester. Then she had a placental abruption and had to have an emergency hysterectomy and the fetus did not survive. Jonathan was then diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma and died, but before he died, he froze his sperm, giving Tovah the hope that she'd eventually bring his child into the world and realize her dream of being a mother.\n\nOver two years later, Tovah was prepared to have a uterine transplant to aid her journey to motherhood. Since she had family in Seattle to help her during her recovery, Addison asked to do her surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial. As Addison operated, the HVAC system at the hospital went out, forcing her to call in Meredith to rush the surgery. After the placed the graft, there was no blood flow, forcing them to detach it to dislodge a clot. Despite this complication, the surgery was a success and Tovah was stable after her surgery. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her transplant surgery, Tovah began having seizures. Addison administered lorazepam and phenobarbital to treat the seizures with no effect. In order to preserve brain function, Addison put her into an induced coma in order to consult with a neurosurgeon for further treatment options. After her CT and labs were evaluated, Amelia ordered an MRI, an EEG, and additional panel-testing to determine her electrolyte and immunosuppressant levels. Because the testing revealed no neurological causes for the seizures, Amelia recommended an increase of anticonvulsants and switching immunosuppressants to combat the likely cause of neurotoxicity from the anti-rejection medication due to the uterine transplant. Addison agreed, and the new treatment plan proved successful. She woke up with the uterine transplant intact and still qualifying for Addison's trial.
