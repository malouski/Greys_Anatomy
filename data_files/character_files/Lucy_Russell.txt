She had been diagnosed in utero with hydrocephalus, meaning she'd need to have surgery to place a shunt shortly after birth. When their mother was 32 weeks pregnant, she was hospitalized until she was ready to deliver, which she hoped would not be until 36 weeks. However, she started having contractions at just 32 weeks. They put her in trendellenberg and put her on magnesium to try to stop the labor. Despite their efforts, her placenta started tearing, forcing them to deliver all five babies at 32 weeks.
