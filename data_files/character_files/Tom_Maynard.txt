Tom was impaled on a metal pole along with [[Bonnie Crasnoff]].\n\n==History==\n===Train Accident===\nTom Maynard was one of the many victims of a train accident brought to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. Tom and [[Bonnie Crasnoff]] were stuck together due to a metal pole puncturing through both of their torsos. After a thorough examination, doctors at Seattle Grace quickly realized that either Tom or Bonnie would have to be removed from the pole to allow the other person to live. Bonnie's injuries were very bad, including a severed spinal column and shredded aorta, leading doctors to decide that Bonnie needed to be moved off of the pole. When doctors approached Tom and Bonnie of their decision Tom was reluctant because he felt that it was unfair for them to choose his life over hers. Eventually Bonnie was able to convince Tom that it was fine she be moved off because he had a better chance of survival. When Tom and Bonnie arrived in the operating room Bonnie asked Tom if he believed in heaven, Tom comforted her by saying that he did. Once Bonnie and Tom were sedated, Bonnie was removed from the pole and quickly passed away. Tom's surgery was successful and he luckily survived the whole ordeal. Tom was later seen\u00a0in a recovery room where he was accompanied by his thankful and excited wife.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====Amanda Maynard====\nVery little is known about the relationship between Amanda and Tom, besides the fact that they are married. During the time Tom was impaled on the pole he made jokes about what his wife would think if she knew he was so close to another woman. However, he said that he believed he would get a free pass because how serious things were. Sometime after Tom and Bonnie went into the OR, Amanda arrived to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and was later seen hugging [[Preston Burke]] in her husband's recovery room.\n\n===Friendships===\n====[[Bonnie Crasnoff]]====\n[[File:In2ulikeatrain.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Tom and Bonnie arriving to Seattle Grace Hospital.]]\nWhile Tom and Bonnie were stuck to the pole they grew close emotionally due to the severe circumstances. Although their situation was very somber, both Bonnie and Tom lightened the mood by making jokes about breath mints and pores. A few minutes before going under Bonnie asked Tom if he believed in heaven, he comforted her, saying that he did believe in heaven.\n\n== Notes and Trivia ==\n*[[Bonnie Crasnoff|Bonnie]] claimed that Tom has very nice pores.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maynard, Tom}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
