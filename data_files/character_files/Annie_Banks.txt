She and her husband had built the wall and razor wire was on shortly after moving into the house, as they didn't trust other people. However, after he died, she decided to take it all down. At the hospital, she was unconscious and hypothermic, which the wire wrapped around her whole body. The wire was wrapped around her leg, cutting off blood flow. When she woke up in the hospital, she panicked and started moving around, further injuring herself. They gave her haldol to calm her down. They then took her to surgery, where they did vascular repair and had to amputate her leg below the knee. When she was told about what had happened, she said she and her husband had built the wall because they didn't trust people and she was trying to take it down because it felt like it was trapping her in. She was pleased to have gotten out.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married until her husband died.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 50 at the time of her accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Banks, Annie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
