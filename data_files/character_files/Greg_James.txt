She and her two kids, Mia and Parker, were pulled from the water and taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Her children only had minor injuries, but Brooke had a perforation of her duodenum and was taken directly into surgery. While they were operating, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] thought of alternatives to why Brooke might have driven off the bridge other than just snapping under the pressure. She suggested an insulinoma, a tumor on the pancreas which would cause an extra secretion of insulin, which explained all her symptoms, including the low blood sugar she had in the ER. They did a trauma whipple to repair the other damage while pathology reviewed her scans, looking for the tumor. They came up with nothing, but Meredith was still convinced it was there, so she looked by hand. It was small, about the size of the head of a pin, but it was there. They removed it and in recovery, they told her husband that all her symptoms, the fatigue, irritability, and stress, were all due to the tumor and now that they had removed it, she'd make a full recovery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Brooke James]]. They have two kids together, Mia and Parker.\n\n===Familial===\nHe has two kids with his wife. He loves them, but isn't much involved with them because he works so much. When Brooke drove her car into the water, he wondered how he could have missed something like that.\n\n==Career==\nWhile he didn't state what exactly he does, he said that he works too much.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*One of his kids plays baseball and one plays violin.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:James, Greg}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
