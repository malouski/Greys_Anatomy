She was postictal after the crash and had a bad elbow dislocation.\n\nCallie reduced her elbow in the ER and Derek examined her and ordered an MRI. The MRI revealed a brain tumor, which had caused the seizure. They needed to do a cookie craniotomy and use a scope to remove the tumor. Before her surgery, she had another seizure.\n\nThey took her into surgery, but the navigational system died during the surgery, meaning Derek had no way of knowing where he was going in her brain.
