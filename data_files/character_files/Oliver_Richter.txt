His EKG looked normal, but Meredith wanted to run a chest x-ray and do a workup. His mediastinum looked a little wide on the portable x-ray, so Meredith called Teddy for a consult. She had Meredith run additional films. His second x-ray showed the same as the first, so Meredith took him for a CT. He started coding in CT. She was able to resuscitate him, but his scan showed an aortic dissection, so they rushed him to the OR. Despite their best efforts, they weren't able to repair the damage and he was pronounced dead in the OR.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married.\n\n===Familial===\nHe has a nine year old son, Max, who is a big fan of basketball. He bought Max basketball tickets for his birthday, but instead of going to the game, he ended up in the hospital where he died of an aortic dissection.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*His ringtone is a baseball charge sound effect.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Richter, Oliver}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
