Since it was her fourth ER visit in three months, the doctors were concerned that Megan was being abused by her foster parents. Knowing that the doctors were suspicious, the Gantrys offered up Megan's file, which went back to long before they got her.\n\nSocial services cleared the Gantrys of any wrongdoing and Megan was diagnosed with CIPA, which caused her to be insensitive to pain. She had to have surgery to repair the damage caused by being hit in the stomach with a baseball bat. The Gantrys stayed by her bedside after her surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Len Gantry]].\n\n===Familial===\nMegan is her foster daughter.
