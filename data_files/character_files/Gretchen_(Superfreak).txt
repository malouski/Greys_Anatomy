She was worried she had cancer. They asked her if there was any chance she was pregnant, but she said that she's a virgin and she and her fianc\u00e9, Danny, are waiting for the wedding night in two weeks.\n\nThey took her into bronchoscopy, where they removed a foreign object that they identified as a condom, which she had aspirated. When they told her the news, her fianc\u00e9, Danny, left, believing she had cheated on him. However, when he came back for his mother's ring, the doctors told him she'd aspirated it while trying to put it on a banana at her bachelorette party. She believed she had swallowed it.
