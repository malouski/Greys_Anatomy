He eventually received a kidney transplant to treat it. At the start of the pandemic, his father told him this was their time to celebrate the doctors who had saved his life by doing their part and staying home. Despite this, Frankie decided to sneak out and go to a party with some of his friends, [[Kayden Lee]], [[Conor Jaxtimer]], and [[Billie]]. On the way there, Kayden's car overheated and Billie was burned when they took the cap off the radiator. Frankie called for help, but after the help left, Kayden tried to use gasoline to cool the car down and started a fire in the car which spread to the surrounding foliage. Frankie and Conor both immediately fled into the woods.\n\nWhile running from the fire, Frankie was impaled on a tree branch, which injured his kidney. ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")''\n\nHe was taken to the hospital where he had surgery. They had to remove a portion of his transplanted kidney, but the remaining kidney tissue was functioning and he was expected to make it. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe's being raised by his father. At the start of the lockdown, his father was strict about him staying home, saying it was his time to do something for the doctors who had helped save his life. When his father learned he had decided to sneak out for a party, he was angry at Frankie.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe is friends with [[Conor Jaxtimer]], [[Kayden Lee]], and [[Billie]]. They were graduating seniors during the pandemic and decided to break quarantine to have a party, which led to a fire and all four of them being injured and Kayden dying.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He missed a year of school while he was sick and would have been valedictorian if he hadn't missed so much.<ref>[[Nothing Seems the Same]], 4x01 (S19)</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nS194x01FrankieMorris.png|[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\n17x02FrankieMorris.png|[[The Center Won't Hold]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Frankie Morris Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morris, Frankie}}\n\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
