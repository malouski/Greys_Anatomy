She wanted the implants to be quite large, which made [[Lexie Grey]] suspicious, thinking Christy was getting the implants for someone else. They inquired about her reasoning and she said that she was getting the new butt only for herself, because she wanted to wear pants and feel like the sexiest woman ever to put on a pair of pants.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 28 at the time of her surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cornell, Christine}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
