He told his father they should share their 'smores with him. They did so and after Jackson learned that Rafi had benign tumors on his scapulae, he offered to fly Rafi and his father back to Seattle to have pro bono surgery to remove them. They planned to remove the tumors so that he could have normal function. However, while he was in surgery, the biopsy revealed that instead of being benign, there was actually cancer in his scapulae. Jackson consulted with Aamir, who asked Jackson to do what he needed to do to keep Rafi alive. They planned to remove his scapula in its entirety, which would leave him with limited function in his arms. However, while they were operating, Jackson had the idea to take the removed scapulae and perform extracorporeal irradiation to kill the cancer without killing Rafi. They performed the surgery and then replaced his scapulae in his body. His father was then told he'd make a full recovery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nRafi's mother died giving birth to him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 11 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He loves camping and anything outdoors.\n*His tumors were diagnosed when he was 8.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elshami, Rafi}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
