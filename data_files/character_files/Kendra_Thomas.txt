She was taken for a CT. [[George O'Malley|George]] informed [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] that she was also pregnant. Her fetus was 12 weeks and healthy.\n\nDerek took Kendra into surgery. He tried helping her, but she was pronounced brain dead. Her parents were told about her condition and they asked about the baby. They wanted to know if they could keep Kendra on life support in order to keep the baby alive long enough for her to deliver.\n\nAddison advised the parents that it was a very bad decision, as there were multiple ways it could go wrong, but they were not convinced.\n\nGeorge later spoke to them and said that from what he had heard about Kendra, she would want to save other lives by letting her organs be donated. He asked them to consider that. They decided to donate her organs.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nKendra's parents came to the hospital when she was injured in the shooting. They wanted to keep her alive in order to allow the pregnancy to continue, but after being reminded that Kendra liked to help people, they agreed to have life support turned off so her organs could be donated.\n\n===Professional===\nKendra is well-liked by her co-workers.\n\n==Career==\nKendra worked at a restaurant as a waitress until her death. She was said to be good with the customers.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 19 when she died.\n*She was described by [[Will (17 Seconds)|Will]] as very nice, covering shifts when needed and standing up to [[Brad Ackles]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thomas, Kendra}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]"}}}]}}}}
