He took his lungs and heart to Portland Medical Center for Terry Class, a 22 year old with cystic fibrosis. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n===Pacific College Shooting===\nDave was working when [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] received incoming GSW-traumas from a shooting at Pacific College. He scrubbed in with [[Pediatric Surgery|peds surgery]] [[Attending#Department Head|head]] [[Robert Stark]] and [[Resident|surgical resident]] [[Alex Karev]] to treat Kelly Keck in O.R. 2. She had suffered gunshots to her leg and abdomen. During the operation, Stark opted to amputate Kelly's leg to help stabilize her condition, which caused an argument between Stark, Alex, and [[Arizona Robbins]], who was watching from the gallery. When Alex was ordered by Robbins to physically prevent Stark from amputation, Dave held pressure to one of Kelly's organs.\n\nWhen Robbins left to gain privileges and have [[Orthopedic Surgery|orthopedic attending]] [[Callie Torres]] treat the leg, Dave stabilized the abdominal trauma and stopped the bleeding. When Torres arrived to assess the leg, she agreed with Alex, much to Stark's chagrin. Robbins shortly arrived to take over the patient, and Stark was forced to leave. Alex was reassigned to the pit, and Dave worked with Robbins and Torres. When the abdominal injuries were repaired, Dave scrubbed out. ''(\"[[Disarm]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nDave is an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*In the second episode that Dave appears, he isn't wearing a personal scrub cap, but rather a disposable one, possibly due to the mass GSW traumas.<ref>[[Disarm]], 7x11</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x01Surgeon2.png|[[Good Mourning]]\n7x11SurgeonDave.png|[[Disarm]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Surgeon Dave Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dave}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
