His doctors tried multiple treatment options, but nothing worked.\n\n===Ben\u2019s Surgery===\nUsing an idea he got from [[Derek Shepherd]], Shane went to Cristina and asked about using embolization glue for Ben\u2019s AVM. She said she never heard of it being used for cardiac AVMs, which are much larger than neuro AVMs. Shane asks if that means it can't be done. She counters that it would take a lot of glue.\n\nWhen Cristina and Shane present the plan to the Boscos, they are disappointed because they've spent a massive amount of money on their traveling and frivolous living, intending for his life insurance money to pay it. They seem intrigued when Cristina mentions that he might die in the surgery.\n\nAfter the surgery was successful, they cried about how they might go to jail because of what they did, but agreed that they would take care of it together.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Ben Bosco]]====\nJoyce is married to Ben Bosco.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her travels with Ben included Morocco, India, and a tour through Europe.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bosco, Joyce}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
