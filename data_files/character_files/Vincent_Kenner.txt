Vincent was taken to the ER, where despite his injuries making survival unlikely, they took him into surgery. In surgery, he had a tear in his renal artery. Webber had Cristina stitch the tear, but because she was used to doing the stitch on the more sturdy tissue of the heart, the stitch didn't hold and his bowel tore. They were able to close and move him to the ICU, where he was stable, but still in critical condition.
