Liz was the one who agreed and she came over to Seattle. When she arrived, she told Meredith she wanted her to always be part of the family, and not only when she needed something. When it was realized that Callie and Jackson would have to take more nerve from Liz's calves for Derek's hand to regain function, Derek initially told Liz that the operation was off. However after Meredith and Liz's discussion which led to Liz pushing Derek towards the surgery, the operation went ahead.\n\nAfter the operation, Meredith, wanting to show Liz her appreciation, visited Liz and showed her her ultrasound, revealing that she's pregnant. Liz was really happy that there would be a new baby in the family. ''(\"[[Run, Baby, Run]]\")''\n\n===Amelia's Visit to New York===\nWhen Nancy ran into Amelia in New York, she invited Amelia to dinner. In an attempt to fix the broken relationships between Amelia and her sisters, Nancy invited Kathleen and Liz to join, but Liz was out of town. ''(\"[[Good Shepherd]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nLiz has several children, whom she mentioned when criticizing Meredith for not visiting or letting her family come to see Zola, as they were excited to see her. Liz's children make up a portion of Derek's 5 nephews and 9 nieces.\n\nLiz feels like her mother doesn't love her.\n\n==Career==\nLiz is a doctor.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Despite that they don't communicate with one another that much, Derek told Liz about the plane crash and\u00a0[[Lexie Grey|Lexie's]]\u00a0death.\n*It has yet to be revealed the [[Specialties|specialty]] that Liz practices. It seems unlikely though that she is another neurosurgeon or a neurologist, as the nerve donation procedure had to be explained thoroughly and Liz was not aware of its consequences to her body.\n*It's also very unlikely that Liz is a mental health professional as [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] conversation with [[Nancy Shepherd|Nancy]] indicated that [[Kathleen Shepherd|Kathleen]] was the psychiatrist in the family, giving the impression that Liz practices another specialty.\n*She went to French preschool.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], 14x04</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n9x08LizShepherd.png|[[Love Turns You Upside Down]]\n9x09LizShepherd.png|[[Run, Baby, Run]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n9x08-10.jpg\n9x08-24.jpg\n9x09-7.jpg\n9x09-12.jpg\n9x09-17.jpg\n9x09-18.jpg\n9x09-19.jpg\n9x09-20.jpg\n9x09-22.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Liz Shepherd Appearances}}\n[[de:Liz Shepherd]]\n[[fr:Liz Shepherd]]\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shepherd, Liz}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
