The last person to be holding the dress won a $100,000 wedding package. While they were competing, she got into a fight with [[Helena Boye]], another contestant, as they were the last two left standing. Even though they were both injured, they refused to let go of the dress and had to be brought to the hospital in the same ambulance.\n\nJackie's shoulder was dislocated and her thigh was lacerated. In order for her to get treatment, they allowed George to act as a proxy for her, holding the dress in her place.\n\nThey reduced Jackie's shoulder dislocation, but after a moment, it popped back out, meaning she'd need surgery. She didn't want to have surgery as she wanted to get back to the contest. However, after hearing that her shoulder would get swollen and bruised, she agreed to have the surgery.\n\nJackie woke up after surgery and immediately asked who won. She was told that her surgery went well, but that Helena had collapsed while she was in surgery and had to be taken in for her own surgery. Jackie believed that that meant that she had won. The doctors told her she should put effort into her marriage, not her wedding. She ultimately lost the competition because George had let go of the dress to catch [[Helena Boye]] when she collapsed.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is engaged to [[Mike (Kung Fu Fighting)|Mike]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 25 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Escott, Jackie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
