When she got her period, he brought her to the clinic to learn how to use pads and tampons. Kelley sat through the explanation, but as soon as her father was out of the room, she confessed that she'd had sex and wondered if she could be pregnant because it happened before she'd gotten her period. [[Miranda Bailey]] talked to her and ran a pregnancy test and STD panel. All the results came back negative, but Bailey warned her that she needed to change her behavior or she would end up pregnant or with an STD.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nKelley had sex with a guy and afterward, he started ignoring her at school and acting like a jerk.\n\n===Familial===\nKelley's mother died when she was young and she was being raised by her single father.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hanson, Kelley}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]"}}}]}}}}
