''(\"[[House Where Nobody Lives]]\")''\n\nJJ spent the final weeks of the pregnancy at Dean's houseboat. ''(\"[[Into the Woods]]\")''\n\nDuring a serious blizzard, JJ was at the station with Dean when she went into labor. Maya called Carina, who advised over the phone how to handle the labor, since they were unable to get to the hospital for the delivery. JJ was upset with this, saying she wanted an epidural to handle the pain. Maya told her that Carina had suggested masturbating in order to progress the labor and help with the pain and JJ did so happily. Not long after that, labor progressed and she gave birth. ''(\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\")''\n\nWhen she was less than a week old, she still didn't have a name. Dean and JJ learned they had different ideas of how to parent. After a few days, JJ packed her things and left the baby with Dean, saying she'd never intended to stay and just wanted to give Dean the chance to keep her if he wanted. She told Dean to give her a good name and a good life before leaving. ''(\"[[Satellite of Love]]\")''\n\nWith JJ gone, Dean struggled to take care of the baby. When Pruitt came over to help, he tried to reassure Dean that he would be okay, but quickly discovered that Dean wasn't sure he was going to keep her. After they spent the day talking, with Pruitt helping with the baby, Dean decided to keep her and named her Pruitt Arike Miller, after Pruitt. Soon after, Vic also moved in and agreed to take shifts with Dean to care for Pru. ''(\"[[Born to Run]]\")''\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, her aunt Yemi started living with her and took care of her. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\n===Dean's Death===\nAfter her father died, Andy, who had been staying with them, brought her to the hospital to go with Ben and Bailey, since Ben had agreed to take her if anything happened to Dean. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhen she was less than a week old, her mother left her with her father, saying she couldn't be a good mom. She told Dean to have their daughter look her up when she was a teenager if she wanted.
