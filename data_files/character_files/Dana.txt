However, his son, Matty, had had abdominal pain for a few days off and on and it got worse, so they went to the hospital, where Matty was diagnosed with gallstones and an inflamed gallbladder. He was taken into surgery, which was supposed to be Stephanie's first start-to-finish surgery. The surgery was going well, but after she finished removing his gallbladder, he became tachycardic because of bleeding. She was unable to stop the bleeding, so Arizona stepped in and converted to an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed bleeding from the superior mesenteric artery from the trocar insertion. She tried to repair the tear, but she was unable to control the bleeding and Matty died in the OR.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Hillary]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe has a son, Matty.
