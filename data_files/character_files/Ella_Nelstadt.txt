He'd had the cough for a few days and wasn't concerned, but Ella was worried and made him go to the hospital. While he was being examined, he had trouble breathing, which was resolved when he coughed up a blood clot which was shaped like a bronchial tree. When he started to struggle to breathe again, he was taken to have TPA injected to break up the clot. He was then diagnosed with Factor V leiden. As the condition is genetic, Danny, Ella's other dad, immediately said Ella needed to be tested. They never wanted to know which of them was her biological father, but knew they needed to know if she had the same kind of condition, so she could properly maintain her health. The test came back positive, though Ella said it didn't matter because they're both her dads.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe has two fathers. They chose not to know which of them was her biological father, unless she wanted to know. She said she didn't, but when one of her dad was diagnosed with a genetic condition, she was also tested for the condition and it came back positive. She said it didn't change anything for her and they were still both her dads.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nelstadt, Ella}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
