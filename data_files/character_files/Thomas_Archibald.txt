Rory found Thomas covered in blood. Rory put the penis in a bag and took it and Thomas to the hospital to be treated.\n\nThe doctors were able to clean the penis and re-attach it. When Marcia showed up at the hospital, they called security, but Thomas revealed that he had called her and planned to forgive her for cutting off his penis and she forgave him for sleeping with Rory, which was against their arrangement, wherein he was allowed to sleep with waitresses and hostesses.\n\nWhen Rory saw that Thomas was going to stay with Marcia, she came into his room and cut off his penis a second time and then took off with it.
