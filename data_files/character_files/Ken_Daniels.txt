He'd used his last access site, meaning he urgently needed a kidney transplant. His mother, Cynthia, had been tested and was a match, so she was planning to donate a kidney to him. On the day he was set to receive his new kidney, Ken came to the hospital after seeing online that Christopher was there for a kidney transplant. Christopher and Cynthia had left him nearly a year prior. He'd been abusive to Cynthia and she left him when he went after Christopher. They asked him to leave the hospital room and he waited in the waiting room.\n\nChristopher and Cynthia were taken into surgery. Unfortunately, after Cynthia's kidney was removed for donation, her remaining kidney thrombosed and died, meaning she had no functioning kidneys left. Because the kidney wasn't yet in Christopher's body, there was debate over whether it was legally his or still hers. They called around to other hospitals looking for any other potential donors. Ken, who was still in the waiting room, overheard and offered to be tested to see if he was a match. He was a match, but they were concerned about him donating, thinking it'd be a way for him to get back into their lives to abuse them again. Jo went in to talk to him before his surgery, saying that the only way to do it and make it about Chris and not himself was to donate anonymously and never tell them.\n\nWhen Chris and Cynthia woke up, they were told what happened and the doctors said that Chris's kidney came from an anonymous donor.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Cynthia Daniels]], whom he abused. She left him when he went after their son. She had previously stayed because she didn't have a job and Chris was sick.\n\n===Familial===\nHe abused his son Christopher as well as his wife, which is what led to his wife taking their son and leaving him.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x14-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daniels, Ken}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
