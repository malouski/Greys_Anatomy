The family often meets up on holidays, although when Derek stopped coming, Kathleen asked Nancy to visit him in order\u00a0to find out why Meredith's panties were on the bulletin board. ''(\"[[Let the Angels Commit]]\")''\n\n===Derek Needing a Nerve===\n[[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] ordered\u00a0[[Heather Brooks]]\u00a0to call all of Derek's sisters to ask them to donate a nerve. Heather mentioned she left Kathleen a message. Kathleen somehow got Heather's phone number and called her back. It is left unknown why she called because Heather hung up on her, and everyone she was on the phone with, on Meredith's orders.\u00a0''(\"[[Love Turns You Upside Down]]\")''\n\n===Amelia's New York Visit===\nWhen Nancy learned that Amelia was in town, she invited Amelia and Link, thinking he was her husband, Owen, to dinner. She also called Kathleen and Liz, though Liz was unable to attend. At dinner, things were tense, but then blew up when Carolyn arrived and revealed the lie. After they discussed Amelia's history, Link and Amelia left. ''(\"[[Good Shepherd]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married. Her husband is a diplomat.\n\n===Familial===\nShe has children. Amelia describes her as Martha Stewart if Martha Stewart had the ability to diagnose you with a mental condition. This indicates that the sisters are not very fond of each other.\n\n==Career==\nKathleen, like the rest of the Shepherd family, is a doctor, trained in psychiatry.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was the last Shepherd sibling to appear on Grey's Anatomy.\n*Meredith mentioned that Kathleen seemed like a good mother, and her children seemed sane, though she wouldn't like to hang out with her often.<ref>[[She's Killing Me]], 9x20</ref>\n*In Meredith's phone contacts, Kathleen is listed as Kate Shepherd.\n*She went to a French preschool.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], 14x04</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x21-3.jpg\n15x21-5.jpg\n15x21-6.jpg\n15x21-8.jpg\n15x21-10.jpg\n15x21-15.jpg\n15x21-16.jpg\n15x21-18.jpg\n15x21-19.jpg\n15x21-20.jpg\n15x21-21.jpg\n15x21-22.jpg\n15x21-23.jpg\n15x21-24.jpg\n15x21-25.jpg\n15x21-31.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:Kathleen Shepherd]]\n[[fr:Kathleen Shepherd]]\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shepherd, Kathleen}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
