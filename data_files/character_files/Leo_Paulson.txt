He was coming back from his morning walk and fell. His doorman, [[Vincent (Season 12)|Vincent]], had tried to catch him, but just couldn't quite get him. He was complaining about pain in his back. They examined him and found a contusion on his back. His wife, [[Angelica Paulson|Angelica]] arrived at the hospital after getting the message Vincent left for her. She was told he was stable for the time being.\n\nAn x-ray showed that his spine was broken at T10, so Callie planned a spinal fusion with a bone graft to treat him.\n\nWhile he was waiting for his surgery, Vincent came to visit him while Angelica was out getting a cup of coffee. He asked if it was all right if he stayed and Leo said it was. They held hands until Meredith came in to talk to him.\n\nIn Leo's surgery, they discovered adenosarcoma, which had spread to his bones and livers and was why his spine snapped. He was told he had only six months to a year to live. When his wife came in, he said he needed to talk to her. Vincent came in behind her and Leo told Vincent that he thanked him for what he'd done, but he could leave, essentially ending things with him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Angelica Paulson]]====\nHe and Angelica have been married for 51 years. Despite his attachment to their doorman, Vincent, he says he loves his wife and was never unfaithful to her.\n\n====[[Vincent (Season 12)|Vincent]]====\nHe says the first time he saw Vincent, his heart leaped out of his chest. When he found out Vincent felt the same way about him, he smiled for weeks. For the next fifteen years, they talked as Vincent's desk, but never crossed a physical line. When Leo found out he had only six months to a year to live, he told Vincent he'd kept him long enough and it was time for him to go.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have three children and seven grandchildren and they're expecting another.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 76 at the time of his cancer diagnosis.\n*According to the prop medication created for him, his primary care physician is Lauren Barnett and his cardiologist is Andrew Reaser (both named after crew members). Additionally, it revealed that he is allergic to sulfa-based drugs and has diabetes, asthma, and high cholesterol.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n12x21-21.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paulson, Leo}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
