The three of them were pulled from the water and taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. Mia had a facial laceration which required stitches, but was otherwise okay, while Brooke had a perforation of her duodenum and was taken directly into surgery. While they were operating, [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] thought of alternatives to why Brooke might have driven off the bridge other than just snapping under the pressure. She suggested an insulinoma, a tumor on the pancreas which would cause an extra secretion of insulin, which explained all her symptoms, including the low blood sugar she had in the ER. They did a trauma whipple to repair the other damage while pathology reviewed her scans, looking for the tumor. They came up with nothing, but Meredith was still convinced it was there, so she looked by hand. It was small, about the size of the head of a pin, but it was there. They removed it and in recovery, they told her husband that all her symptoms, the fatigue, irritability, and stress, were all due to the tumor and now that they had removed it, she'd make a full recovery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nMia lives with her parents and her brother, Parker. Her mother works hard to take care of her and her brother, which is why it was shocking when she drove off a bridge with the kids in the car.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was ten at the time of her hospitalization.\n*Her father mentioned that violin and baseball are his kids' hobbies, but it's unknown which kid does what exactly.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:James, Mia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
