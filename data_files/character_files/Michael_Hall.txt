However, this surgery was unsuccessful and they were forced to put him back on the transplant list.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nMichael lives with his parents, who are very supportive of him and his decision to attempt valve replacement instead of waiting for a second heart transplant.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x03-1.jpg\n10x03-3.jpg\n10x03-5.jpg\n10x03-8.jpg\n10x03-12.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hall, Michael}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
