Because of this, they decided to get prophylactic gastrectomies.\n\nWhen he heard the possible side effects, Mike decided not to have the surgery, hoping he'd be the 1-in-4 not to get the cancer. Megan also decided to back out, though after they found a tumor in Tricia's stomach, she changed her mind and had the surgery. Mike, however, didn't change his mind. Though Tricia pledged to keep on him until he finally had the surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe has a girlfriend.\n\n===Familial===\nDue to the gastric cancer gene running in their family, the Shelley family was down to a branch. They had lost their mother, grandfather, aunt, and uncle to the disease and had a cousin in hospice care.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 23 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He's the president of his fraternity.\n*He goes snowboarding.\n*He likes jelly beans.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shelley, Michael}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Genetics)]]"}}}]}}}}
