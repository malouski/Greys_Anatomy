His wife, Sally, became his caretaker.\n\n===Car Accident===\nSally left Martin alone while she went to shower. She said she usually hid the keys, but she must have forgotten. Martin took the keys and went out. He thought he was going to a shoe store, but he actually crashed his car into the home of [[Blair Vinson|Blair]] and [[Tom Vinson]], seriously injuring all three of them. He also totaled the car. He was taken to the ER, where he continued to resist treatment efforts, still believing he was at a shoe store.\n\nSally arrived at the hospital soon after and explained that Martin had Alzheimer's. He was quickly taken into surgery, where they treated his rib fractures and internal injuries. After his surgery, his wife was shocked that he was completely lucid. She believed that [[Richard Webber]] had cured his Alzheimer's. However, doubting that that was the truth, [[Amelia Shepherd]] ran some more tests and discovered that instead of Alzheimer's, Martin actually had normal-pressure hydrocephalus. She said she she could place a shunt which would drain the fluid into his abdomen, relieving the dementia.\n\nHowever, after speaking to the police and discovering that the car accident he caused in his confusion killed a pregnant woman, he decided that he couldn't live with the guilt and decided not to have the surgery, meaning that the fluid would build up again and he'd go back to being confused and having no memory. He told Sally then to put him in a home and walk away. Sally sat with him as he recited the poem and started to forget words.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Sally Davis]]. When he proposed, he recited a poem to her. When he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, she became his caretaker. When he became lucid again, she was delighted and said she had missed him.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and Sally have two kids, Lisa and Toby. Lisa had gotten married and divorced while he was not lucid and his wife told him Toby had turned it around and was in his second year at Penn State.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 65 at the time of his car accident.\n*He and his wife have a 17 year old cat named Heidi.\n*He likes football.\n*The poem he recited to his wife was ''I Arise From Dreams of Thee'' by William Cooper.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x16-1.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Martin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
