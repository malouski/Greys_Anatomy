He was convinced it was just an expired inhaler to blame and asked for a new prescription. Bailey had him moved to an isolated room and ordered tests, including a COVID swab. He said that wasn't necessary as he knew COVID was fake. Bailey later reported to him that his COVID test had come back positive. A chest x-ray had shown ground glass opacities in his lungs, which is why he was short of breath. He also had a clot in his leg and what dermatologists were calling COVID toe, a rash specific to COVID patients. Chad still believed it was fake and refused to accept her diagnoses, saying runners don't get blood clots. He refused her prescribed treatment and signed himself out of the hospital against medical advice. Before he could get far, he collapsed outside the hospital. Teddy, Mabel, and Bailey attempted resuscitation, but Chad died despite their best efforts.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x12-1.jpg\n17x12-27.jpg\n17x12-28.jpg\n17x12-29.jpg\n17x12-30.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, Chad}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
