He refused a tetanus shot when it happened. He came into the hospital when he developed rictus sardonicus. He again refused treatment for tetanus, calling it poison and saying that [[Jo Wilson|Dr. Wilson]] was a puppet for Big Pharma.\n\nHis condition worsened and his abdomen was rigid, but he still refused treatment for tetanus. Then his arm spasmed and broke. He was taken into surgery after scans revealed a previous break that hadn't healed properly. They had to re-break his arm in order to re-align the bone so it would heal properly.\n\nAfter surgery, his brother asked for a list of all the materials they'd used, amused that they'd put so much into his brother's organic, grass-fed body.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\n====Father====\nLogan and Abraham's father died when they were young, done in by corn beef hash and cigarettes. Since his death, Logan has become obsessed with what he puts into his body, even medical treatments.\n\n====[[Abraham Treadwell]]====\nLogan is close with his brother, Abraham, to the point where Abraham came to be with him when he was hospitalized. After surgery, Abraham requested a list of all the materials they'd used in surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Treadwell, Logan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
