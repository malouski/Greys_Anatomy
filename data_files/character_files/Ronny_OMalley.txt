He enjoys hunting and has an interest in cars.\n\n==History==\n===Thanksgiving===\nEvery year, Harold took his three sons out hunting to shoot a turkey. When he was an intern, Harold insisted that it would be George's year to shoot the turkey. While they were out in the woods, the others started trading cars, but George didn't participate. They believed it was because he didn't know anything about cars, but he explained that it was always the same conversation over and over again and he was tired of it. George ultimately did shoot the turkey, but as they were packing up, one of them accidentally shot Harold in the butt. George took him to the hospital where he removed the birdshot and stitched him up. ''(\"[[Thanks for the Memories]]\")''\n\n===Father's Cancer===\nRonny and Jerry both came to the hospital after Harold fell and broke his clavicle. They were both there when he received the news that Harold had cancer and also needed a valve replacement. Callie used car metaphors to help them both understand how serious his medical issues were. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\n===Dad's Death===\nWhen Harold's organs started shutting down, his family was informed that he would not be able to wake up and they were given the choice to let nature take its course or turn off life support. They chose to turn off life support and stayed with him while he died. ''(\"[[Six Days, Part 2]]\")''\n\n===George's Death===\nRonny and Jerry were out on a fishing expedition in Alaska when George died. Their mother told them about his death when they came home. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n==Personality==\nRonny is very much like his father and brother, but also very clumsy when it comes to being careful. Ronny's foolishness led to the shooting of his father. Even though their father was fine, it made Ronny just the slightist bit more aware. Ronny knows how to look at the bright side, just like the rest of the men in the family (Except George). Ronny isn't the smartest, but still has a positive outlook on life, sticking through tough moments.\n\n==Relationships==\nHe has a strong bond with his brother, [[Jerry O'Malley|Jerry]], and his parents. His bond with George isn't as strong.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a postal worker.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n209RonnyO'Malley.png|[[Thanks for the Memories]]\n308RonnyO'Malley.png|[[Staring at the Sun]]\n310RonnyO'Malley.png|[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\n311JerryandRonnyO'Malley.png|[[Six Days, Part 1]]\n312RonnyO'Malley.png|[[Six Days, Part 2]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x09-1.JPG\n2x09-2.JPG\n2x09-3.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Ronny O'Malley Appearances}}\n\n[[es:Ronny O'Malley]]\n[[fr:Ronny O'Malley]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:O'Malley, Ronny}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
