He threw himself in front of a group\u00a0of kids to shield them from the impact and was seriously injured himself. He was taken to the ER, where he was awake and responsive, but unable to speak. He was rushed into surgery, where his liver was actively bleeding and his spleen had to be removed. While he was having surgery, he had a CT of his head, which showed a growing epidural hematoma, so he had a craniotomy to stop the bleeding. After his surgery, his wife was told he'd be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have children.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parson, Dean}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
