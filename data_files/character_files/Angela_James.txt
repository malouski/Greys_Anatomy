They were both taken to the ER, where Angela was found to have a displaced clavicular fracture and weak pulse in her right arm. [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] ran a CTA, which showed a torn subclavian artery, so Angela was taken into surgery to repair the damage. The surgery went well and Angela was expected to make a full recovery.\n\nWhen her father found out that his diabetic nerve pain had likely caused the accident, he felt guilty. He hadn't told Angela about having diabetes, however, he eventually told her the truth.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother is dead. She and her father were in a car accident together. When he was diagnosed with diabetes, he hid it from her because he didn't want to upset her.\n\n===Friendships===\nHer parents were close with [[Adele Webber|Adele]] and [[Richard Webber]]. She even calls Richard \"Uncle Richard.\"\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:James, Angela}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
