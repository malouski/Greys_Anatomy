She was surprised to learn that the pen was for an erectile dysfunction drug, as she didn't work for the company and had only taken the gig passing out pens because it paid well. He asked her to have a drink with him and she tried to turn him down because she still had pens to pass out. He took all the pens from her and then she joined him for a drink. The two of them later married and had two children.\n\n===Cancer and Death===\nAbigail developed fibroids in her uterus and had to have a hysterectomy. The doctor used a medical device that was supposed to allow for a minimally-invasive hysterectomy, but the device accomplished that by using using tiny spiny claws to break up the tissue, which had the side effect of spreading cancer around her abdomen, which was previously an isolated tumor that would have been easily removed. Abigail underwent treatment for the cancer, including two clinical trials, but she unfortunately died.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to Cormac Hayes until her death. They met at a medical conference he was attending.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and Cormac had two sons together: Liam and Austin. When she figured out she was going to die, she said she wanted them to know it was okay to cry and feel everything.\n\nShe has [[Irene Davis|a sister]] who lives in LA. Abigail said she's crazy, but she loves Austin and Liam.\n\n==Career==\nShe was a mixed-media artist. However, when a pharmaceutical company offered her $500 to pass out pens at a medical conference, she took them up on it.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 33 when she had her hysterectomy.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayes, Abigail}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
