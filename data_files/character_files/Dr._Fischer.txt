Fischer and\u00a0[[Richard Webber|Webber]] removed the fish from Larry's penis. They were initially going to remove it without opening him up, but they were unable to, so they opened him up and Dr. Fischer said he'd repair the damage to the bladder.\n\n==Career==\nDr. Fischer is an\u00a0[[Attending|attending]]\u00a0[[Urology|urologist]]\u00a0at\u00a0[[Seattle Grace Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Dr. Fischer, like [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] and later [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]], opted for no personal scrub cap. Instead he wore the standard scrub cap that matches his attending scrubs.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n3x21-19.jpg\n3x21-26.jpg\n3x21-29.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fischer, Dr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
