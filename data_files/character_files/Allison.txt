He attempted to rape her, but failed as she bit off the end of his penis and swallowed it. He still beat her severely and left her there.\n\nShe was brought to the hospital with severe injuries and rushed into surgery. During the surgery, the portion of the penis she bit off was recovered and collected as evidence for the assault trial. They repaired the damage as best they could, but Derek said he wasn't sure if she'd wake up or not and if she did, it would take a lot of rehab to recover completely.\n\nHe continued to monitor while she was unconscious. When her ICP spiked, he had to do a craniotomy and had to leave the skull flap open until the pressure in her brain went down. He was there with her when she did ultimately wake up.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nBoth of Allison's parents are dead.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She has a pair of shoes the same as Meredith's.\n*She was 25 at the time of her hospitalization.\n*She moved to Seattle three weeks before being assaulted.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n1x02-9.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
