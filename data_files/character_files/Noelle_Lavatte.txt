Noelle informed the doctors she was born with two uteruses and found out that one of the babies was developing more slowly than the other because she was conceived a full six weeks after her brother. At that point, Noelle and her fianc\u00e9 both figured out that he wasn't the father of the second baby because they broke up briefly when she told him she was pregnant.\n\nGreg left and shortly afterward, Noelle was breathing heavily and one of the babies was having bradycardia. She went into labor and had to have an emergency c-section to deliver her son in the hopes that it would stop labor on her daughter.\n\nIn surgery, Addison had to have George hold one uterus away from the other so she could deliver only one baby without harming the other. However, just as Addison went to deliver Noelle's son, her daughter started moving heavily. Alex stepped in and did sports talk, which her father used to calm her down, and that sedated her enough that Addison was able to deliver the boy without complications.\n\nAfter the delivery, Noelle was stable and labor stopped on the other uterus. Noelle had some confusion and forgot after a few moments that she'd been told that Greg wasn't there. After she asked the third time, Greg came into the room. He said he'd been to see their son, whom he said was amazing. He then put his hand on Noelle's belly and asked about their daughter.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is engaged to [[Greg Stanton]]. When she became pregnant, he proposed to her and gave her an ultimatum. She said no and they broke up. While they were apart, she slept with another guy and became pregnant in her other uterus. She and Greg got back together and Noelle agreed to marry him, but when she was hospitalized for her pregnancy, they discovered that their daughter was conceived after their son, which is why she was so much smaller than her brother, meaning that Greg wasn't the father of both babies. He left again briefly, but after being asked if he was involved of committed ([[Ham or Eggs?]]), he came back and claimed both babies as his own.\n\n===Familial===\nShe has a newborn son and is expecting a daughter.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She stayed in room 2314.\n*She hates weddings and kids scare her.\n*Her blood type is B+.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lavatte, Noelle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]"}}}]}}}}
