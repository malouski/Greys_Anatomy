Eddie was in a head-on collision and despite Bailey's best efforts, he died of his injuries.\n\n===Pregnancy===\nThree weeks after her husband died, Glenda found out she was pregnant. She was uninsured, so she went back to the hospital where her husband died seeking prenatal care. During a prenatal visit, [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] found that the baby had a tumor on his lower back. She asked Herman to take the case and once [[Julie Hall|Julie Hall's]] case was dropped due to fetal demise, Herman agreed.\n\nAn exam revealed that Glenda's baby was developing hydrops and it was starting to put Glenda herself at risk, so Herman recommended operating that very night. However, Glenda refused because she was only 24 weeks and knew her baby wouldn't have much of a chance for survival if they had to do an emergency delivery at that point. She decided to wait the extra week, despite the risks to herself. Herman agreed to allow her to wait, but only if she was admitted and carefully monitored.\n\nA week later, Glenda's baby went into distress and she started mirroring, so she had to be rushed into surgery.

She was then discharged to go home and told to return in a month for a post-op exam.
