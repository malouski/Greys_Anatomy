His meds at home hadn't been working. After treatment in the ER, he was still having trouble breathing. [[Teddy Altman]] listened to his heart after seeing cardiomegaly on his x-ray. She determined that he was having a heart attack and needed surgery. In surgery, they found that his coronary artery was attached to his pulmonary artery instead of his aorta. They repaired it in surgery. His anastomosis didn't hold, but they fixed it and he came through the surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nCasey's mother came to the ER with him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 8 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He had what they thought was a febrile seizure when he was three months old.
