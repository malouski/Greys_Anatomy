He landed on a pile of tree trimmings and was impaled on a particularly large branch.\n\nThey took him into surgery, where they had to remove one of his kidneys and part of his bowel. They worked around the branch, knowing it was tamponading the bleeding. Eventually, they were able to repair enough of the surrounding damage to remove the branch.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHarley's parents are divorced. As he only sees his father every other weekend, his father allowed him to do things he wouldn't have previously, like street luging down a hill, which led to his accident.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 14 at the time of his accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hernandez, Harley}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
