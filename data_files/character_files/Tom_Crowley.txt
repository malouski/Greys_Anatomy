He had a minor injury to his wrist, so [[Lexie Grey]] bandaged it. However, she'd had to change her lab coat earlier in her shift and hadn't moved her ID badge, which Tom noticed. He believed she was out to get him because of his paranoid schizophrenia and ran away. Security found him, but he got spooked and fell down a flight of stairs, lacerating his spleen.\n\nHe was worried that they'd implanted a camera into him. He didn't want to disturb his mother, who was sleeping, so he asked Lexie to talk him down. She showed him the ultrasound of his abdomen and showed him that there was bleeding, but no camera. She left the monitor up so that he could reassure himself any time he needed to. They were just going to watch the bleeding to see if it would resolve itself, but because his mother needed surgery, they operated on him to convince her to have surgery because then they could go through everything together and not have to be separated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nTom's mother was his sole caregiver. His father left right after he got sick.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*The number five bothers him.\n*He likes shopping.\n*Underground parking makes him upset.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crowley, Tom}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}}}]}}}}
