He was suspected of having bombed the mall. Being so close to the blast meant that he was left with ruptured eardrums. While being questioned by [[Ray Pelletier]], he collapsed. He was diagnosed with peritonitis and bowel perforation with a probable traumatic brain injury. He was taken into surgery to repair the damage.\n\nWhen he came out of surgery, Ray again tried to question him before a phone call informed him that the explosion was caused by a gas main, not a bomb, ending the investigation.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\n====Nicky====\nMike's friend, Nicky, was also in the blast. However, he died as the result of being so close to the explosion. When he was being questioned by Ray Pelletier, Mike asked about Nicky.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Mike}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
