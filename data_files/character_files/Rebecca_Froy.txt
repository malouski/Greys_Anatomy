Rebecca was happy to help and suggested she could stay a few extra days after coming to Washington to give a presentation, but she abruptly backed out when she heard GSM was a Harper Avery hospital. Amelia tried to get to her elaborate, but she just hung up. Jackson spoke to her and said his grandfather was dead and asked her to reconsider, but she said she'd signed an NDA and hung up on him. Jackson then decided to go to the legal team and have them waive the NDA that was blocking her, believing it was just a spat over some research.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a neuroscientist at The Neuro Institute in Chicago. She is doing research into using ultrasound waves to remove tumors.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She knows [[Tom Koracick]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Froy, Rebecca}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
