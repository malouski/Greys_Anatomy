''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\n===Taking Orders===\nAlex gave Cecil several orders for various patients. After a few, he grabbed a notebook to write them down, fearful he wouldn't remember them. Later that day, Owen told him to page the head of vascular when he brought in [[Yan Huang]], who had a ruptured AV fistula. Cecil said they didn't have one and paged Richard instead. They then took Yan to the OR and Cecil was allowed to scrub in. ''(\"[[It's Raining Men]]\")''\n\n===ICU Patients===\nCecil helped Owen monitor patients in the ICU. When multiple patients crashed unexpectedly, they traced the cause back to spoiled blood transfusions. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n===Cassidy Gardner===\nWhen [[Cassidy Gardner]] came into the ER after falling down a flight of stairs, Cecil helped Owen examine her. When Owen did an abdominal ultrasound, he asked Cecil what he saw on the ultrasound. Cecil asked if it was excess fluid, but it was actually a heartbeat. Cassidy was pregnant. ''(\"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Internship|intern]] at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*In his first appearance, he was credited as E.R.
