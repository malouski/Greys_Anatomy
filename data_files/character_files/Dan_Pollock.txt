They expected that surgery would repair her heart and she'd be okay, but in surgery, the doctors repaired the defect, but her heart was so diseased that Stacy needed a heart-lung transplant and needed constant medication while she waited for it. A missed dose would mean she'd die. When her parents were upset at the idea of her having to stay in a hospital bed, [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] proposed an alternative, that she wear a backpack with a bump, which would allow her to live her life normally while she waited for a transplant.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Lisa Pollock]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have a daughter, Stacy.
