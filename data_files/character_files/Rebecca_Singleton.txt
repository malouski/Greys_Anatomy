Before the biopsy, they ran labs that Bex had unbalanced hormone levels, indicating the use of birth control pills. George asked Bex about it and Bex said they were trying to make their breasts grow.\n\nAddison took Bex for the biopsy, but they discovered that the tumor was compressing what they believed was an ovary. The pathology report revealed that it was actually a testes, meaning Bex is intersex. They talked to Bex's parents and called for a psych consult. The parents were told that physically, Bex would be fine as the tumor was benign, but the doctors encouraged the whole family to get therapy.\n\nBex's parents came to Addison and said they didn't want to tell Bex and asked Addison to remove the male sex organs when she went in to remove the tumor. Addison declined and said they'd have a hard time finding a doctor who would agree to it.\n\nBefore Bex's surgery, unable to lie, George forced Bex's parents to tell them about their condition. Bex's parents were upset and George was taken off the case, but he later went to check on Bex and said they didn't have to be a boy, but they could if they wanted to. He then started to cut Bex's hair at Bex's request. Bex's parents came in and their mother took over the haircut.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nBex's parents were unable to help when they struggled with depression in middle school. When they found out Bex was intersex, they tried to have Bex's male sex organs removed and didn't plan to tell Bex about it. However, after George started to cut Bex's hair, Bex's mother stepped in and finished.\n\n===Friendships===\nBex had a best friend named Jen who stopped hanging out with them when she became interested in boys.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Bex likes to draw comics.\n*Bex cut themselves.\n*Bex was 14 at the time of their hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Singleton, Rebecca}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Genetics)]]"}}}]}}}}
