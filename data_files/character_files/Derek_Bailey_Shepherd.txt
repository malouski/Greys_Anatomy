He has two siblings, an older sister, [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]], and a younger sister, [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]].\n\n==History==\n===Meredith's Pregnancy===\nMeredith found out she was pregnant three weeks into her pregnancy, a few months after [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] died. She told Derek by buying a shirt for Zola that said \"World's Best Big Sister\". At first, she was convinced that she would miscarry, which is why she only told him, and not even [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]].\u00a0''(\"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\")''\n\n===Birth===\nMeredith went into labor in the middle of a super storm. The labor was going smoothly until the OB determined that the baby had face presentation. He was then born via emergency c-section in the dark during the storm. In the operating room, the doctors had to hold flashlights so that [[Connie Ryan|Connie]], the OB, could see to deliver him. After he was born, his breathing was shallow and his sats were low, so he was taken to the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]] to be monitored and receive oxygen. After he was born, [[Shane Ross|Shane]] noticed that Meredith had suffered from a massive splenic hemorrhage caused by her fall down the stairs. [[Miranda Bailey]] performed surgery to stop the hemorrhage and saved Meredith's life, thus Meredith named her son after her.\u00a0''(\"[[Perfect Storm]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Attack===\nA few weeks after Meredith was attacked by a patient, [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] and [[Alex Karev|Alex]] brought Zola, Bailey, and Ellis in to see her. However, the three of them were too scared by her appearance and the visit was brief. After she had recovered, the family was happily reunited at home. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n===Fifth Birthday===\nFor his fifth birthday, he wanted a superhero party. After Alex had to back out of helping set up the party to operate on a patient and the entertainment cancelled, [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]] offered to help her. They set up the party and Link even pretended to be Thor when Bailey asked if he was. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n===Thatcher's Death===\nWhen [[Thatcher Grey|Thatcher]] died, he left presents for Ellis, Bailey, and Zola in his closet. Meredith took those presents to her kids and told them about their grandpa. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n===Meeting Andrew===\nAfter Zola caught [[Andrew DeLuca]] trying to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night, Meredith sat Bailey and his\u00a0siblings down with ice cream and told them that Andrew was at the house because the two of them were dating. Bailey asked Meredith if she would kiss Andrew, to which she said she probably would. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\n===Saying Goodbye to Meredith===\nJust before Meredith decided to turn herself into the police for committing insurance fraud, she sat Bailey, Zola, and Ellis down and told them that she would be gone for a while. Bailey asked where Meredith was going, and she said she had to take care of something very important. She didn't give them details, but assured them that Alex, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], and [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]] would be there for them. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Community Service===\nWhen Meredith was doing community service, Bailey found her vest and asked if he could wear it to school. She told him no, saying she needed it to go to work. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\n===Halloween===\nHe dressed as a football player for Halloween. Meredith was released from jail that day and missed trick or treating with them, but got home in time to help them sort candy. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n===COVID-19 Pandemic===\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Bailey stayed home with his sisters, Amelia, Link, and his new cousin, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] while his Mom treated COVID patients at the hospital and eventually became sick with COVID-19 herself and had to be admitted. He had an exceptional amount of energy during this time, making Link comment that he needed some kind of outlet for it. When Amelia realized she'd missed Link's birthday, she convinced the kids to watch a movie by saying it was Link's birthday wish, giving them some free time. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nFor his birthday that year his Mom asked him what he wanted and he told her he wanted a big cake all to himself. His Mom bought it for him and at his birthday party he stuck his face right in the cake and then licked the icing off his fingers and made a big production of it. This made everyone who was at the party: his sisters, his Mom, Amelia, Link, and Maggie laugh. Meredith realized that that\u2019s what he really wanted for his birthday was to make them all laugh because at the time the COVID-19 Pandemic was all over the news and his cousin Scout who was just a baby was keeping all of the adults in the house up all night. As a result, no one in the house was laughing much. His Mom said he looked just like his father Derek the way he lit up. (\"[[Breathe]]\") \n\nShortly after Andrew died, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis had a dance party in the backyard while the grieving adults supervised and tried to figure out how to tell the kids, who had loved Andrew. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n===Play Date===\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n===Visiting Mt. Rainier===\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n===Meredith Waking Up and Coming Home===\nBailey and Ellis stayed home with Maureen while Maggie took Zola to the hospital to see Meredith in the hopes it would help encourage her to wake up. While they were gone, Bailey and Ellis made a fort. When Link and Amelia returned, they asked to be let into the fort. Bailey and Ellis denied them entry without the password. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her pulmonary studies showed a remarkable improvement in her lung capacity and her labs came out clear, Meredith was discharged from the hospital. Instead of leaving to a fanfare, she had Jackson slip her out the back and drop her off at home, where her kids greeted her happily. Because she hadn't told anyone she was coming, the kids' welcome home poster was unfinished, but she appreciated it anyway and asked her kids to tell her everything that had happened while she was gone. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n===Christmas===\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Maggie and Winston's Wedding===\nIn August 2020, Bailey attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. However, at the wedding, Maggie's father and Winston's grandmother opposed the wedding, wanting to wait until more people could attend, so the wedding was postponed. In April 2021, a new wedding was planned and they all attended. Bailey walked down the aisle with his mother and siblings to spread flower petals at the start of the ceremony. During the reception Bailey, along with both of his siblings, held engagement rings for Link as he proposed to Amelia on the beach after the ceremony. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Meeting Addison===\nAfter working with Addison on a surgery and talking to her about Derek, Meredith invited Addison to her house to meet her kids. They were happy to meet her and asked if she was a friend of their dad's. She said that she was and they immediately got along. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was named after his father and\u00a0[[Miranda Bailey]], his parents' colleague who saved Meredith after she delivered him.\n*For his first Halloween, he was dressed as a pumpkin.<ref>[[Thriller]], 10x07</ref>\n*He is almost always called Bailey.\n*While he was being watched by his Aunt [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], he once spilled an entire bag of flour on the floor.<ref>[[Trigger Happy]], 12x20</ref>\n*Before falling unconscious, Meredith said that she knew his name but was put under anesthetic before she could tell anyone. It is unknown if she had the name Bailey in mind at the time, as Bailey hadn't saved her yet.\n*Before his birth, Meredith and Cristina occasionally referred to him as \"fetus.\"\n*When discussing names, Derek said he liked William and Meredith liked Sebastian.\n*He is the only one of his parents' three kids to be born in the hospital where they work, as well as the only one born in Seattle.<ref>[[Perfect Storm]], 9x24</ref>\n*He went through a phase of saying funny before every sentence.<ref>[[The Winner Takes It All]], 15x11</ref>\n*He also had a phase with pyromanic tendencies, causing his caretakers to hide anything that he could start a fire with.<ref>[[The Center Won't Hold]], 17x02</ref>\n*Given [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison's]] reaction upon meeting him, it is heavily implied that he bears a striking resemblance to his [[Derek Shepherd|father]].<ref>[[Hotter Than Hell]], 18x03</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\"
