And I've held a lot of babies, I've fixed a lot of babies. But, I looked down at Zola, and I don't know what it was, but I just couldn't imagine her being with any other parent or with any other family. We've been trying so hard to start a family, and she needs one. Let's adopt her. I'm serious, let's adopt her.|[[Derek Shepherd]]}}\n{{Quote|Derek, is that our baby?\" \"Yes. Yes it is. |[[Meredith Grey]] and [[Derek Shepherd]]}}\n\n'''Zola Grey Shepherd''', born '''Zola Limbani''', is [[Meredith Grey]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek Shepherd's]] eldest daughter and child. She has a younger brother, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]], and a younger sister, [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]].\n\n==History==\n===Health Problems===\nZola was born with spina bifida. She came to Seattle from Malawi with a group of African kids who needed surgery. She was six months old at the time. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\nAfter she had recovered from her brain surgery, she had a second surgery to repair a hernia. [[Arizona Robbins]] said it was an uncomplicated hernia, so it was an easy fix. ''(\"[[I Will Survive]]\")''\n\n===Adoption===\nShe first arrived at Seattle Grace Mercy West thanks to [[Alex Karev|Alex Karev's]] Africa Project. Derek was the first one to take a shine to her because when he was holding her to examine her, she stopped crying and Alex remarked that she liked him. Later that day, he suggested the adoption to Meredith and she agreed. They started to fill out the adoption paperwork and came to the question that asked if they were married. Derek then proposed they get married. They went to the courthouse and got married and then skipped [[Callie Torres|Callie]] and Arizona's wedding reception to go back to the hospital to spend time with Zola. ''(\"[[White Wedding]]\")''\n\nMeredith and Derek were granted temporary custody of Zola not long after Derek found out that Meredith had tampered with his trial to ensure that [[Adele Webber]] got the active agent. However, Meredith brought her home alone, because Derek was mad at her. She told Zola that she had a plan for the day she came home, but nothing went according to the plan. She told Zola she was very glad she was there and they'd figure it out together. ''(\"[[Unaccompanied Minor]]\")''\n\nTwo weeks later, Zola was taken away from them due to Meredith being fired and lying to [[Janet Meyers|the social worker]] about the status of their marriage. ''(\"[[She's Gone]]\")''\n\nWhile in foster care, Zola [[Love, Loss and Legacy|came into the hospital]] because her shunt was malfunctioning and that caused an intestinal blockage. She underwent a major surgery performed by Alex Karev and Arizona Robbins. Meredith and Derek were distraught, but they could not see her because the adoption was still under examination. When Alex finally told them the surgery had gone well, Meredith burst into tears and Derek finally forgave her for what happened with the clinical trial. Later that night, they sang a lullaby to her over the phone while [[Cristina Yang]] was taking care of her at the hospital. ''(\"[[Love, Loss and Legacy]]\")''\n\nLater, Meredith and Derek got a hearing to try to regain custody. This was probably thanks to Alex tracking down the judge and telling him that Meredith and Derek were the best possible parents for Zola. ''(\"[[Put Me In, Coach]]\")''\n\nDespite this, not long after that phone call, the social worker told Meredith that since their hearing had been canceled, they were probably not going to get custody. ''(\"[[Dark Was the Night]]\")''\n\nHowever, the following morning, she brought Zola to Meredith and Derek's and told them that the baby was theirs and they had full custody. ''(\"[[Suddenly]]\")''\n\n===First Birthday===\nFor Zola's first birthday, her parents planned a party with their friends. However, when the celebration for Richard's 10,000th surgery had to be canceled, they used the cake Meredith made for the birthday to celebrate that instead. ''(\"[[Hope for the Hopeless]]\")''\n\n===Being Babysat by Lexie===\nMeredith and Derek tried to have some time for themselves the morning of Valentine's Day and asked [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] to listen for Zola. She did and they went outside to have some alone time, but shortly thereafter Lexie knocked on the car window carrying Zola and apologized telling them that Zola woke up and really seemed to want them. They all went back inside and Lexie offered to babysit Zola for the night so that they could have some time to themselves since she had no plans. They took her up on the offer and Lexie babysat Zola for the night. \n\nAfter telling [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] earlier in the day that Zola was her hot date for the night Lexie carried Zola around the house, talking to her about whether or not she should go over to Mark's and tell him that she still loves him. When Derek and Meredith got home, Lexie asked if they could take her so that she could leave, but Derek told her to take Zola with her and drive her around as she loved that. Lexie decided to do so and showed up at Mark's apartment with Zola, saying she thought the Zola and Sofia could have a play date and they could talk. She then realized that [[Jackson Avery|Jackson]] was there and was making Mark dinner. Mark invited them in and Zola and Sofia had a play date while Mark, Lexie, and Jackson had dinner together. ''(\"[[All You Need is Love]]\")''\n\n===Getting Sick===\nThe same day Meredith had to leave for San Francisco to take her boards, Zola got sick, which made Meredith feel guilty for leaving her. Derek promised Zola would be fine and took care of her as she threw up on all her clothes, leaving her to wear a bumblebee costume. ''(\"[[Moment of Truth]]\")''\n\n===Planned Move and Plane Crash===\nWhen Meredith was offered a job at The Brigham, the family planned a move to Boston. However, shortly before they were set to leave, her parents were both involved in a plane crash. ''(\"[[Flight]]\")''\n\nDerek still wanted to go to Boston, but Meredith looked at the condition the others were in and said she wanted to stay in Seattle because that's where she started her family. ''(\"[[Remember the Time]]\")''\n\n===Genome Mapping===\nWhen Bailey got her genome lab up and running, Meredith came to her with Zola and said that she wanted to be around to fight for her kid, so she needed to know if she was going to get Alzheimer's. She realized she didn't know anything about Zola's genes, so she wanted Bailey to map her as well. ''(\"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\")''\n\n===Daycare Accident===\nWhile at daycare, Zola fell and needed two staples in her head. She'd been promised a princess tea party that day, but because of her parents' busy work schedules, she didn't get it. ''(\"[[I Bet It Stung]]\")''\n\n===Halloween===\nFor Halloween, Zola went as a butterfly. Her butterfly wings ripped, so Derek fixed them with [[Ben Warren|Ben's]] help. They when went trick or treating with baby Bailey, plus [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres|Sofia]] and her moms. ''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\n===Amelia's Visit===\nWhen [[James Peterson]] proposed to [[Amelia Shepherd|Amelia]], she fled to Seattle to think. She took care of the kids while she was there, something she found difficult. ''(\"[[Change of Heart]]\")''\n\n===Derek's Time in DC===\nAfter Derek decided to go to DC to work with the NIH, Zola spent some time sleeping in the bed with Meredith. ''(\"[[Where Do We Go From Here]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek realized what he was missing and said he didn't want to miss anymore, he prepared to move back. ''(\"[[When I Grow Up]]\")''\n\n===Derek's Death===\nOn the day Derek left for his final trip to DC to tie up loose ends, he was in a car accident. Meredith took Zola and Bailey with her to the hospital, where they stayed with a social worker while Meredith had life support turned off and sat with Derek while he died. ''(\"[[How to Save a Life]]\")''\n\n===Zola Calls the Ambulance for Meredith===\nZola, Bailey, and Meredith moved to San Diego temporarily after Derek died. Meredith was pregnant with a new baby. Around the time she was due, Meredith's water broke on the kitchen floor. She tried to act like everything was all right, but she fell down and went into labor. Zola saw the blood and asked if she should call 911. This reminded Meredith of the time her mother slit her wrists and bled out in front of her. Her mom then told Meredith not to dial 911 yet. Despite remembering that event, Meredith told Zola to call 911, and she was taken to a hospital. The social worker at the hospital asked Zola if she was the \"smart girl who knew how to call 911\" and Zola nodded. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\n===Return to Seattle===\nAfter Ellis was born, Meredith took her three kids and moved back to Seattle. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")''\n\nMeredith decided she couldn't keep living in the house Derek built, so it was sold and they moved back to the house where they lived when they first got Zola with Amelia and [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]]. ''(\"[[You're My Home]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Attack===\nA few weeks after Meredith was attacked by a patient, Arizona and Alex brought Zola, Bailey, and Ellis in to see her. However, the three of them were too scared by her appearance and the visit was brief. After she had recovered, the family was happily reunited at home. ''(\"[[The Sound of Silence]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Harper Avery Nomination and Win===\nWhen Meredith was nominated for a Harper Avery, Zola was supposed to go with her to Boston for the ceremony. However, Zola knew her mother didn't like flying, so she wasn't surprised when Meredith decided not to go. Instead, she spent the day with Maggie learning some anatomy. They later watched from the gallery as Meredith watched the feed of the awards and learned she had won. ''(\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\")''\n\n===Alex and Jo's Wedding===\nZola was asked to be a flower girl at [[Jo and Alex's Wedding]]. They arrived at the wedding to find that most of the guests weren't there because the GPS link on the wedding website sent them to the wrong place. While waiting for the ceremony to begin, Zola and Sofia, who was also a flower girl, played together. After a series of mishaps, including the wedding planner having an allergic reaction to shrimp and being sent to the hospital, the wedding party and guests boarded a ferry, where Alex and Jo were married by Meredith and Zola performed her duties as flower girl. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Fashion Show===\nWhen Meredith came home with new outfits, Zola requested a fashion show. Meredith agreed to show off one outfit because it was late and they needed to get to bed. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\n===Bake Sale===\nWhen Zola's school was having a bake sale, she asked Meredith to make chocolate cookies, not chocolate chip. ''(\"[[Everyday Angel]]\")''\n\n===Dia De Los Muertos===\nOn Dia De Los Muertos, Zola and her friend, [[Angela]], dressed up and had their faces painted for a parade at their school. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n===Bailey's Birthday Party===\nZola attended her brother's fifth birthday party. ''(\"[[Help, I'm Alive]]\")''\n\n===Thatcher's Death===\nWhen Thatcher died, he left presents for Ellis, Bailey, and Zola in his closet. Meredith took those present to her kids and told them about their grandpa. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Dream===\nZola appeared in one of Meredith's dreams. In the dream her grandmother [[Ellis Grey|Ellis]] told Zola something to tell to her mother, then told her to write it down quickly. ''(\"[[Blood and Water]]\")''\n\n===Meeting Andrew===\nWhile getting water in the middle of the night, Zola caught [[Andrew DeLuca]] trying to sneak out of the house after a night with Meredith. Later, Meredith sat Zola and her siblings down with ice cream and told them that Andrew was at the house because the two of them had been spending more time together. When Zola asked if Andrew was Meredith's boyfriend, Meredith said yes. Zola was fine with their relationship but requested that Andrew not bring his guitar\u00a0like the last time he stayed over. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\nDuring breakfast, Amelia talked to Meredith about Andrew, and Zola asked if they were talking about Meredith's boyfriend. Amelia said that they were and was surprised that Meredith had told Zola about Andrew. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\n===Saying Goodbye to Meredith===\nJust before Meredith decided to turn herself in to the police for committing insurance fraud, she sat Zola, Bailey, and Ellis down and told them that she would be gone for some time. Zola asked how long Meredith would be gone, and she said just for a little while. Meredith didn't give them details but assured them that Alex, Maggie, and Amelia would be there for them. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n===Shunt Revision===\nZola came to Meredith one morning saying she felt sick. She had a headache that persisted through breakfast, so Meredith took her to the hospital and demanded that [[Tom Koracick|Tom]] get her a CT immediately, reporting to him Zola's medical history. Tom did the CT, which showed that she just needed a shunt revision, commonly required when children grow. He took her in for surgery, which went smoothly. After her surgery, Zola was awake and recovering. ''(\"[[Breathe Again]]\")''\n\n===Halloween===\nAt Halloween, Zola wore her butterfly costume again. When Andrew tried to help her put the wings on, she got upset with him and said he's not her dad. She later told Andrew that her father had fixed her wings before he died and she didn't want people to forget him. Andrew assured her that that would never happen. ''(\"[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\")''\n\n===Alex's Departure===\nZola came to Meredith one day, saying that she'd finished her science project and she wanted to show Alex. Meredith then had to explain to her that Alex wasn't coming back to Seattle. ''(\"[[Leave a Light On]]\")''\n\n===Richard's Presentation===\nZola helped hook up Meredith's computer to the television so she and Meredith could watch [[Richard Webber|Richard]]'s PATH pen presentation together. They watched the presentation, but quickly realized something was wrong. He presented, but wasn't making any sense. Meredith asked Zola to get her phone for her. Shortly afterward, the stream was disconnected. ''(\"[[Love of My Life]]\")''\n\n===COVID-19 and Meredith's Illness===\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Zola stayed home with her brother and sister, Amelia, [[Atticus Lincoln|Link]], and her new cousin, [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln|Scout]] while her mom treated COVID patients at the hospital and eventually became sick with COVID-19 herself and had to be admitted. When Amelia realized she'd missed Link's birthday, she convinced the kids to watch a movie by saying it was Link's birthday wish, giving them some free time. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\nPrior to her mom getting sick, Zola attended her brother's birthday party that year where he stuck his face right in the cake and then licked the icing off his fingers and made a big production of it. This made Zola, Ellis, Meredith, Amelia, Link, and Maggie laugh. Zola laughed so hard she peed her pants which just made everyone laugh even harder. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nWhen Meredith ended up in a coma on a ventilator due to COVID-19, Zola overheard Amelia talking about Meredith being sick and became worried that her mom was going to die. Amelia and Maggie later sat down with her and explained to her what was happening. She was worried, but simply said they shouldn't tell Bailey and Ellis unless they had to, because they were too young to understand. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\nShortly after Andrew died, Zola, Bailey, and Ellis had a dance party in the backyard while the grieving adults supervised and tried to figure out how to tell the kids, who had loved Andrew. Zola also later talked to Amelia about living forever and if they'd choose it or not. Zola said if she could create a medicine that would make someone live forever, she'd give it to her mom. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\n===Play Date===\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n===Visiting Mt. Rainier===\nLater, Eric and Maureen Lincoln bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n===Meredith Waking Up===\nZola increasingly struggled with her mom being sick, especially after the death of George Floyd. She knew Meredith would be angry as well, but told Maggie she didn't want to go to any protests without her mom. One day, after learning she signed out of her math class early, Maggie talked to Zola about her struggles and encouraged her to scream to express how she was feeling. Later, Winston had the idea to sneak Zola into Meredith's hospital room in the hopes it would encourage her to wake up. After putting Zola in PPE, they walked her through to Meredith's room. She stood by Meredith's bedside and spoke to her until she woke up, then hugged her happily. ''(\"[[Good as Hell]]\")''\n\nAfter her pulmonary studies showed a remarkable improvement in her lung capacity and her labs came out clear, Meredith was discharged from the hospital. Instead of leaving to a fanfare, she had Jackson slip her out the back and drop her off at home, where her kids greeted her happily. Because she hadn't told anyone she was coming, the kids' welcome home poster was unfinished, but she appreciated it anyway and asked her kids to tell her everything that had happened while she was gone. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\n===Christmas===\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Maggie and Winston's Wedding===\nIn August of 2020, Zola attended Maggie and Winston's backyard wedding. However, at the wedding, Maggie's father and Winston's grandmother opposed the wedding, wanting to wait until more people could attend, so the wedding was postponed. In April 2021, a new wedding was planned and they all attended. Zola helped her mother spread flower petals on the beach in preparation for the wedding and then she walked down the aisle with her mother and siblings to spread more flower petals at the start of the ceremony. During the reception Zola, along with both of her siblings, held engagement rings for Link as he proposed to Amelia on the beach after the ceremony. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Meeting Addison===\nAfter working with Addison on a surgery and talking to her about Derek, Meredith invited Addison to her house to meet her kids. They were happy to meet her and asked if she was a friend of their dad's. She said that she was and they immediately got along. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\n====Parents====\nZola quickly bonded with Derek after he and Meredith decided to try to adopt her. Meredith bonded with her as well, but more slowly.\n\nDerek occasionally struggled with being a white man raising a black daughter. He tried to set up a playdate between Zola and Bailey's much older son, [[William George Bailey Jones|Tuck]], though Bailey shot that idea down. She suggested to him that the reason people were staring wasn't that he's white and Zola's black but because he didn't know how to do Zola's hair and it didn't look good. She showed him how to do Zola's hair properly. ''(\"[[If Only You Were Lonely]]\")''\n\nWhen Derek later learned about [[Maggie Pierce]], he encouraged Meredith to try to bond with her, saying Zola needed more black people in the family because he was running out of ways to braid Zola's hair and Bailey wouldn't show him anymore. ''(\"[[Don't Let's Start]]\")''\n\nAfter baby Bailey was born, Zola's parents worked to make sure she knew she hadn't been replaced by her brother. In order to give Meredith more time for her work, Derek decided to step back from his work and stay home with the kids more. ''(\"[[Map of You]]\")''\n\n====Siblings====\nAfter her brother Bailey was born, Meredith said Zola wanted to take him to daycare to show him off. ''(\"[[Seal Our Fate]]\")'' Zola has been shown to be very protective of her younger siblings and asked her aunts not to tell them bad news about their mom's condition when she was sick with COVID-19 unless they absolutely had to. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\n===Friendships===\nShe and [[Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres]] are friends. When Zola was gone after Derek died, Sofia asked when she'd be coming back and insisted on getting her a Christmas present. ''(\"[[She's Leaving Home]]\")'' They frequently had play dates together when they were little and have been seen playing together on multiple occassions and at family events such as birthdays and weddings. \n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She started to walk shortly after being returned to Meredith and Derek, to the great delight of her parents.<ref>[[This Magic Moment]], 8x11</ref>\n*She really likes her toy giraffe.
