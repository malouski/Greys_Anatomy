When Rachel wanted to leave, Jillian did not want her to go alone and accompanied her. They settled in Seattle and got jobs working in a restaurant. Since Rachel was baptized before leaving, she could not return to the community.\n\n===Hospitalization===\nUpon being admitted, Jillian stated that she had visited a clinic over a year ago and had been told to see an oncologist, but she had not as she would not have been able to afford the medical bills. Shortly after being admitted, Jillian's parents showed up at the hospital. Rachel was furious as she had told Izzie not to call them. Mr. and Mrs. Miller were not allowed to speak to Rachel as she had been 'shunned' for leaving the community. They were able to speak to Jillian though as she had not yet been baptized. It turned out that Jillian had called her parents. She confined in Izzie that she wanted to go home and die Amish.\n\nIn surgery, Addison and Miranda noticed that Jillian's cancer had spread from her cervix and into her bladder, meaning that the cancer was Stage IV and inoperable.\n\nIzzie broke the news to a devastated Rachel and told her that Jillian would get worse and that she wanted to go home to die. Rachel refused at first. However, Izzie convinced Rachel that if she really loved Jillian, she would let her go. Rachel and Jillian later said their goodbyes. Jillian was reluctant as if she went home and was baptized she, too, would have to shun Rachel. Rachel, however, reassured her that she would be fine in Seattle. Before she left, Jillian's mother broke her silence and told Rachel that she would tell her mother that she saw her and that she was happy and had grown into a fine young woman.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe was separated from her family because she chose to leave the Amish community in order to follow her best friend, Rachel, who had been shunned for leaving after she was baptized.\n\n===Friendships===\n====[[Rachel (Great Expectations)|Rachel]]====\nShe and Rachel have been best friends since infancy. Their friendship, as they said, was \"cradle to grave.\" However, when Jillian became sick and longed for her family, Rachel agreed to leave her and Jillian went back to the Amish community with her parents.\n\n==Career==\nShe's a waitress at a restaurant. Rachel works at the same restaurant.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She and Rachel were born two days apart.\n*She speaks both English and Pennsylvania Dutch.\n*She was 23 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miller, Jillian}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
