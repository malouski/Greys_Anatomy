He initially refused to get out of the car, but when he finally did, the doctors saw that he had warts covering most of his body. He had HPV and an immune deficiency that allowed the warts to grow out of control. His wife was upset because the warts had caused him to isolate himself in their house. He'd had two prior surgeries to remove the warts, but they'd grown back both times.\n\nThey took him into surgery to remove the warts and start skin grafts, but the healthy skin started to grow warts before they could graft, meaning he'd have to wait six months to a year to get his grafts. His wife said she didn't care about the warts, but knew that he'd continue to isolate himself, so she left while he was sleeping.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Jerry Adams]]. He hadn't allowed her to touch him in four years because of his warts. She left him when she learned it'd be another six months to a year before he could get skin grafts to improve his appearance.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n7x03-14.jpg\n7x03-19.jpg\n7x03-24.jpg\n7x03-27.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adams, Tess}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
