Sally became his caretaker.\n\n===Car Accident===\nSally left Martin alone while she went to shower. She said she usually hid the keys, but she must have forgotten. Martin took the keys and went out. He thought he was going to a shoe store, but he actually crashed his car into the home of [[Blair Vinson|Blair]] and [[Tom Vinson]], seriously injuring all three of them. He also totaled the car. He was taken to the ER, where he continued to resist treatment efforts, still believing he was in a shoe store.\n\nSally arrived at the hospital soon after and explained that Martin had Alzheimer's. He was quickly taken into surgery, where they treated his rib fractures and internal injuries. After his surgery, his wife was shocked that he was completely lucid. She believed that [[Richard Webber]] had cured his Alzheimer's. However, doubting that that was the truth, [[Amelia Shepherd]] ran some more tests and discovered that instead of Alzheimer's, Martin actually had normal-pressure hydrocephalus. She said she she could place a shunt which would drain the fluid into his abdomen, relieving the dementia.\n\nHowever, after speaking to the police and discovering that the car accident he caused in his confusion killed a pregnant woman, he decided that he couldn't live with the guilt and decided not to have the surgery, meaning that the fluid would build up again and he'd go back to being confused and having no memory. He told Sally that he wanted her to put him in a home and walk away. Sally sat with him while he recited the poem and he started to forget words.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Martin Davis]]. When he proposed, he recited a poem to her. When he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, she became his caretaker.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and Martin have a son named Toby who was said to be stupid. However, he rallied and was in his second year at Penn State. Their daughter, Lisa, got both married and divorced while her father was not lucid.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She and her husband have a 17 year old cat named Heidi.\n*The poem Martin recited to her was ''I Arise From Dreams of Thee'' by William Cooper.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x16-1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Sally}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
