She was unsure of her decision to have a mastectomy and wondered if a lumpectomy would be a better choice. Her husband asked Dr. Bailey to talk to her and convince her that the mastectomy was the better choice, but she was worried about being perceived as soft, so she said it wasn't her place and offered to have [[Mark Sloan]] come up and talk to her about reconstructive options.\n\nMark came and Anna was disinterested in looking at the implant options, saying that her husband was the one who had to feel them, so he should choose. Her husband went to Bailey again and said that she needed to tell Anna that she needed to have the surgery.\n\nBailey went to Anna's room and talked about her experience with her own son. She correctly deduced that she felt guilty for blaming her son for her cancer.\n\nBailey then watched Gus while Anna and her husband talked about the situation. Bailey said she believed they were leaning toward mastectomy.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Mr. Nyles]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe has a young son, Gus. She felt guilty because she resented him because she was breastfeeding and thought the tumor was just a clogged milk duct. While she was hospitalized, she refused to hold him because of that.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 30 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n3x05-10.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nyles, Anna}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
