They went to 18 different battlefields in a year. They were planning to go to Pearl Harbor next.\n\n===Consultation with Derek===\nWes was diagnosed with a neuroblastoma. Because she was concerned about him knowing about his condition, his mother didn't tell him about his tumor. However, he overheard some doctors talking about it, but he hid it from his mother that he knew. Eight different surgeons, including the tumor board at [[Cleveland Clinic]], said his tumor was inoperable. Wes's mother, Lynn, took him to Derek in the hopes that he'd be able to operate. He said he would try, but warned her that there was only a 5% chance he'd be successful. Once he opened Wes up, he discovered that there was no way he could operate without killing Wes, so he closed without doing anything.\n\nAfter the surgery, Lynn told Wes that the surgery wasn't as hard as they thought it would be, but Wes figured out that they didn't actually do anything.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married and they had one son, [[Wes Connors|Wes]]. Her husband died when Wes was two.\n\n===Familial===\nHer son, Wes, had a neuroblastoma. They had seen eight surgeons who all said it was inoperable, so she took him to see Derek, who agreed to try. However, Derek was also unable to do anything, leaving Wes with about three months left to live.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Connors, Lynn}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
