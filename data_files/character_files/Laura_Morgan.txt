When a call from UNOS came in, Laura immediately wondered if it was the heart for Samantha. Stephanie informed Laura and [[Noah Rutstein|Noah]] that a heart had become available, but since Rhys's condition had worsened in the OR, it would be going to him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nLaura stayed with her daughter in the NICU while she waited for a heart transplant. When the available heart went to [[Rhys Rutstein]] instead, Laura was devastated as she knew her daughter was dying.\n\n===Friendships===\nWhile in the NICU with her daughter, Laura developed a friendship with [[Noah Rutstein]], whose son, Rhys, was also in the hospital. They stayed with each other while the doctors reported on their children, saying it helped to have a second set of ears for all the medical jargon. When they saw [[Stephanie Edwards]] approaching after a call came in from UNOS while Rhys was in surgery, they automatically joined hands. Their relationship was tested when the heart, instead of going to Laura's daughter, went to Noah's son. When she saw Noah watching over his son after his heart transplant, she went over to reassure him that Rhys wouldn't reject the heart and placed her hand on top of his.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She played solitaire on her phone so she wouldn't have to watch her baby die.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morgan, Laura}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
