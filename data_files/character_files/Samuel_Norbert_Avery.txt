After hearing that the baby's bones were already starting to break in the womb, causing him pain, April and Jackson decided to allow Dr. [[Nicole Herman]] to induce labor at 24 weeks. Their son, whom they named Samuel Norbert Avery, was born. He was quickly baptized and his parents held him until he died.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Samuel is the second baby of a main character who died shortly after birth.
