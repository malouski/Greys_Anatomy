He was cancer-free until he came in complaining of hip pain. A PET scan revealed that the cancer had recurred in his hip. Callie believed that she'd have to do a hip replacement after removing the tumor. They took him into surgery, but discovered that he didn't have enough blood flow to support his recovery. She had to place an external fixtator to keep his leg attached to his body, but he was left without a hip. She then developed a plan which would split his fibula and use the vessels from that to bridge the gap. He was later seen walking with a physical therapist.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Laurie Lasher]]. They have two kids together.\n\n===Familial===\nHe has two children with his wife..\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 33 at the time of his hip surgeries.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lasher, David}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
