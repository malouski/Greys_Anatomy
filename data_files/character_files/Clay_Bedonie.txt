Six years later, he needed another heart transplant, but he felt he was being haunted by the ghost of his donor, a girl hit by a car while hitchhiking, so he didn't want it. He just wanted them to remove the old heart and give it to him for a purification ritual.\n\nWhen he heard that Izzie was being haunted by Denny, he asked that she not work on his case.\n\nThey took him into surgery and removed the donor heart. They were shocked when the native heart was beating on its own. The doctors believed the six years of rest had given his heart time to rest and repair itself, but he believed it was because he wasn't haunted anymore.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nHe says his friend who follow the old ways didn't want him to get the first heart transplant.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He's a member of the Navajo tribe.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bedonie, Clay}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
