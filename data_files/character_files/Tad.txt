Unconcerned, Vik parked him in a bed and said he'd come back to pack it. When he returned, hours later, Tad was still bleeding and started coughing up blood. They tried to get the bleeding stopped, but he'd lost a lot of blood and they couldn't get good access to transfuse blood, so he died.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*[[Vikram Roy]] was fired over his handling of Tad's case.\n*His time of death was 17:57.\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
