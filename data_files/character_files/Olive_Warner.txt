She sponsored him through AA.\n\nWhen she learned that Richard was seeing Ellis again, she warned him off it, saying that he was having an emotional affair with the person who drove him to drink in the first place.\n\n===TIPS Procedure===\nOlive had a TIPS procedure that failed.\n\n===Bleeding===\nA month after her procedure, she came into the ER with upper GI bleeding. Her TIPS procedure had failed. She was on the transplant list, but her cirrhosis was so severe that she needed help to wait for one.\n\nRichard told her she needed a portacaval shunt, which had a 50% survival rate. He'd done nine before, with four surviving. She said it was perfect because she'd be five out of ten. She had the surgery and survived it. ''(\"[[Superstition]]\")''\n\n===Cardiomyopathy===\nOlive collapsed at an AA meeting. She was resuscitated in the field before they noticed her DNR bracelet. They then took her to Grey Sloan, where she requested Richard, calling him her personal physician. She knew she had cardiomyopathy due to her liver failure and had accepted that she was going to die. Despite this, Richard brought in Maggie and Meredith to find a way to save her. They examined her, but had to tell Richard there weren't any good options and he finally accepted that she was going to die. He brought Amelia with him into her room so they could have a meeting together. ''(\"[[Hold Back the River]]\")''\n\n===Death===\nShe remained in the hospital until her death. She passed away slowly with Richard sitting by her side for days. ''(\"[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\n====[[Richard Webber]]====\nShe was very close with [[Richard Webber]]. She was his sponsor for AA when he got sober the first time. They talked at least three times a week, sometimes even three times per day. She considered them to be more than normal friends. He sat by her side for days until she passed away.\n\n====[[Gretchen (Superstition)|Gretchen]]====\nShe referred to Gretchen as her new baby, a woman who had been sober for six months.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She held an AA meeting in her hospital room.<ref>[[Superstition]], 2x21</ref>\n*Her favorite drink was a vodka tonic.<ref>[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]</ref>\n*Her first appearance was in [[Superstition]] and her second in [[Hold Back the River]], a 280-episode gap, at the time the longest for any character. This record was later broken by [[Nancy Shepherd]].\n*The epitaph on her tombstone reads \"Happy, Joyous, and Free.\"<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], 15x06</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n221OliveWarner.png|[[Superstition]]\n14x18OliveWarner.png|[[Hold Back the River]]\n14x19OliveWarner.png|[[Beautiful Dreamer]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Olive Warner Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Warner, Olive}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
