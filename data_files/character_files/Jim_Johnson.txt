They were taken to the ER, where he complained of chest pain. He had a laceration on his head, but despite this, he got off the backboard and went to his daughter, concerned about her because she was pregnant. When Marshall was brought into the ER after them, Jim said he'd kill him and had to be held back. His forehead laceration was stitched and his hand was bandaged. His scans were clear, so he was discharged.\n\nMelanie's injuries were much more serious than the others', so the family waited at the hospital while she was taken into surgery. They were later informed that Melanie's injuries were catastrophic. Betty and Jim waited with Noah in his room while the doctors took her into surgery. After she reached the triangle of death, they moved her to the ICU, where she stayed until they were ready to take her back into surgery. Unfortunately, she died during the second surgery and her baby had to be delivered. After some initial trouble breathing, the baby was stable in the NICU and Noah sat next to the incubator.\n\nWhen Marshall asked for the chance to apologize to Melanie's family, Jim went to his hospital room to see him. After a moment where he looked very angry at Marshall, Jim put his hand on Marshall's face and they both cried as Marshall apologized.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Betty Johnson]]. Together, they have one daughter, [[Melanie Reynolds|Melanie]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe is very protective of his daughter, Melanie. When she was injured in a car accident, he refused to let the doctors treat him until he had checked on her and her baby.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*According to George, he \"owns half of Alabama.\"\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x24-5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Jim}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
