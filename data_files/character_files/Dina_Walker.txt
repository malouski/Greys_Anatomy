When his tests were negative, [[Alex Karev]] and [[Arizona Robbins]] wanted to run an exploratory laparoscopy. Dina's husband, Jim, initially refused, believing that Brad was just faking, but when Alex told him that Brad could die if he had what they thought he did, his parents agreed.\n\nBrad was moved to the ICU after surgery and his parents were angry that the laparoscopy hadn't shown anything. However, Brad started bleeding from his chest and had to be rushed into surgery. He had a ruptured aortic arch dissection which was the cause of his pain.\n\nBrad's surgery was successful and his parents were told he was doing fine.
