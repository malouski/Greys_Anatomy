He'd had two prior surgeries to treat his condition. He came in for an exploratory laparotomy with possible bowel resection. Alex used a technique that would allow the healthy portion of his bowel to glow under black light. However, in surgery, Alex discovered that very little of the bowel was viable and so he had to close and tell Sam's son, Jason, that he was going to die.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married. His wife died of a stroke.\n\n===Familial===\nHis son, [[Jason Kenton|Jason]], dropped out of college one semester before graduating to help take care of him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 55 at the time of his final surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kenton, Sam}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
