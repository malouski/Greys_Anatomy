She was initially upset at her sister, feeling she did it to herself by refusing to get out of the tree. She tried to get Willow to sign a deal with the company to pay her medical bills in exchange for her agreeing not to sue them, but when she realized that the company had decided that the cost of knocking her out of the tree was lower than letting her stay, she decided that they were going to sue the developers for $10 million.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe and her sister don't get along well due to their conflicting beliefs about Willow's activism. However, when Willow was seriously injured when a developer knocked her out of a tree, Julie filed a lawsuit against the developers.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a lawyer. When her sister was injured after the tree she was in was cut down, she decided they were going to sue the company that chopped down the tree.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zelman, Julie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
