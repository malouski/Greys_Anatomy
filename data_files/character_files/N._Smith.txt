Smith''' is a police officer who pulled Winston over on his way to Seattle.\n\n==History==\nN. Smith pulled Winston over while he was driving from Boston to Seattle. When he heard Maggie on the phone, he asked Winston to hang up the phone. When Winston tried to stay on the call, Smith took it as him not complying with police request, so Winston hung up. Ultimately, Smith told Winston he was pulled over because his bike rack had obscured his license plate, but while he was stopped, they made Winston unpack his whole car and let their dog sniff it all as well as sniffing him directly.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a police officer.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He drives car 1712.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, N.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Police Officers]]"}}}]}}}}
