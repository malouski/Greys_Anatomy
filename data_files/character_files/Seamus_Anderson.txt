Colin was rushed to the hospital, where they determined that the bullet had gone through his hand into his chest. His fingers were broken, but he had good blood flow to his hand, meaning it was salvageable. They took him into surgery, where they removed the bullet and repaired the damage to his chest while Jackson worked on his hand. They had to remove a portion of one of his lungs, but his father was told he'd compensate well after some rehab. Jackson was also able to save his hand and put in pins to repair the fractures. After his surgery, he was resting in his hospital room with his father when they heard [[Pete]] downstairs playing a song by himself to cheer Colin up.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nAfter his son was shot during a parade, he stayed by his side at the hospital every moment except while he was in surgery.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He and his son play in a Scottish pipe band with [[Pete]].\n*When Seamus is walking beside Colin to the OR, he talks about the Dunblane massacre  which took place at Dunblane Primary School near Stirling, Scotland, United Kingdom, 13 March 13, 1996. The shooter, Thomas Hamilton, shot sixteen pupils and one teacher dead, and injured fifteen others, before killing himself. \n\n==Gallery== \n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x13-3.jpg\n15x13-4.jpg\n15x13-5.jpg\n15x13-6.jpg\n15x13-17.jpg\n15x13-18.jpg\n15x13-19.jpg\n15x13-20.jpg\n15x13-22.jpg\n15x13-23.jpg\n15x13-24.jpg\n15x13-25.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, Seamus}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
