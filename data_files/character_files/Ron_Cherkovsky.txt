However, he had bone spurs and no cartilage left in his hip, so he couldn't avoid it any longer. [[Callie Torres]] suggested a minimally invasive hip replacement, which would shorten his recovery. They were dubious about why Callie had an availability that day, so they wanted to get another opinion. They got the second opinion, but Ron decided he wanted Callie to replace his hip. His surgery went well.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Sheila Cherkovsky]].\n\n===Familial===\nHis daughter is an orthodontist in Sarasota.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cherkovsky, Ron}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
