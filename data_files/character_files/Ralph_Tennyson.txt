He saw [[Wendy Cole]] among them and when her son, [[Truman Cole|Truman]] was separated from her, Ralph picked him up and carried him to the hospital, where he was reunited with his mother. Ralph also told the doctors about Wendy being one of the drug users, which they hadn't known.\n\nWhen he went to leave, he was stopped by Alex, who noticed that Ralph's shoes were so worn they weren't protecting his feet and he had lesions on his feet. He was taken to a room where his feet were debrided and then his feet were bandaged. He was told to keep them clean and dry, but as he was living in the park, he wasn't sure how he'd be able to do that. He'd maxed out the number of days he was allowed to stay at all the shelters. Jackson desperately called around to try to get him into a shelter, but when he was fruitless, he offered Ralph all the camping supplies he had in his trunk, to keep him warm and dry while he waited for a bed at a shelter to open up.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 75 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tennyson, Ralph}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
