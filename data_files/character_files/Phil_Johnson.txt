They reviewed footage of all areas of the hospital looking for him. He said it wasn't a Code Pink situation.\n\nWhen Alex asked what if it were Bailey's own son, she called the Code Pink. Phil said that no one would be able to get through any of the doors without a security badge, locking the whole place down. Alex stole one of those badges and then quickly searched the hospital for Gage's father, whom he believed had taken him. Instead, he found Gage hiding under a staircase and the Code Pink was called off.\n\nPhil, still upset, came to Bailey later to sign a damage report. The report also declared that she's the one who called the code.\n\n==Career==\nPhil is head of security at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Phil}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Support Staff]]"}}}]}}}}
