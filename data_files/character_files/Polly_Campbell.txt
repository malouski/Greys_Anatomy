She'd gone along because it was his first time without an instructor and he wanted her to go with him. They were both air-lifted to the ER, where Polly had bleeding in her abdomen. When she started to struggle to breathe, Meredith put in a chest tube, which stabilized her. She was then taken for a CT, which showed a grade III splenic laceration. Since there wasn't active bleeding, they decided to watch it. She was stable for a while, but then she started seriously bleeding. She was taken into surgery for the splenic rupture and while she was in there, her aorta dissected. They rushed to stop the bleeding as quickly as possible. After her surgery, she was awake and stable, but she mentioned she couldn't feel her legs, but believed the anesthesia was still wearing off. Tests showed that she had damage to her spinal cord from the bleeding during surgery and had irreversible paralysis. When she was told the news, she asked to see her husband, who had been paralyzed for three years.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe has been married to [[Daniel Campbell]] for three years. They were engaged when he was in an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down. He gave her an out if she wanted to leave, but she decided to stay and brought the chaplain to his hospital room so they could marry immediately.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 33 at the time of her hospitalization.\n*She's afraid of heights.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Campbell, Polly}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
