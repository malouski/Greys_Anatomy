He had a depressed skull fracture and was rushed into surgery to repair the damage. The surgery was successful, but a CT post-op revealed a large aneurysm. He was taken back into surgery, but despite their best efforts, his brain swelled, his pupils became fixed and dilated, and he had no gag reflex, meaning he was likely brain dead.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 35 at the time of his death.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tate, Steve}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
