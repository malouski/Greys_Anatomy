He developed a romantic relationship with [[Meredith Grey]]. He was the younger brother of [[Carina DeLuca]].\n\n==History==\n===Early Life===\nAndrew was born and raised in Italy. His father, also a surgeon, used to take him and his sister Carina out fishing. While in a manic episode, his father operated on seven people in a row without food or sleep and lost four of his patients. Because of his connections, he got away with it, but Andrew's mother left him over it. She then took a young Andrew with her and moved to the United States, while his father and Carina stayed in Italy.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], 15x09</ref> At some point, his mother went back to visit his sister in Italy. While she was there, he received a call from Carina that their mother had gotten sick and that he needed to get there as soon as possible. When he arrived, he learned his mother had died even before the call, but Carina couldn't handle telling him that over the phone as she wanted to be able to hug him after delivering the bad news.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], 15x04</ref>\n\nRight after high school, Andrew worked as an EMT. He said he loved it and it's what made him decide to go to medical school. His second call out was an MVC. He arrived to find a woman in the front seat bleeding from her neck. He was trying to stop the bleeding, but she was wailing, holding her dead toddler in her arms. That's when he decided not to go into peds.<ref>[[I Choose You]], 12x03</ref>\n\nWhile living on the East Coast, he met [[Sam Bello]] and they had a tumultuous, on-and-off-again relationship. When they broke up, she wouldn't return his calls. In an attempt to get her attention, he kidnapped her dog, so she broke into his apartment to get it back. He then moved across the country to the West Coast without telling her goodbye, so she blocked him on all social media and they didn't hear from each other for years.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], 14x07</ref>\n\n===First Day===\nOn his way to his first day as an intern, Andrew came across the tunnel collapse. When [[Joan Paulson]] was extracted, he rode in with her in the ambulance. When they ran out of splints, he used his tie to stabilize her wrist. After Joan was taken into the hospital, he asked if he needed to fill out paperwork, but Owen, not knowing Andrew is an intern, said that he could do it later if he was okay jumping in and continuing to help.\n\nAndrew was forced to admit that he was only an intern when Joan's neck dislocated and he didn't know how to help Stephanie fix it.<ref>[[Time Stops]], 11x23</ref>\n\nWhen the doctors realized they'd need to get [[Keith Gardner]] to an OR quickly so he wouldn't bleed to death, Andrew, along with the other interns, was posted along the path to clear the way. He then rounded out his first day by rounding on [[Joan Paulson]], who was by then stable and expected to make a full recovery.<ref>[[You're My Home]], 11x24</ref>\n\n===Housing===\nBecause the other interns believed he had posed as an attending on purpose, they didn't want to live with him or be friends with him, so when [[Arizona Robbins]] posted about having a room available to rent, he jumped at the chance. She was initially suspicious, but said they could work it out, and they eventually became friends shortly after.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], 12x01</ref>\n\n===Anatomy Class===\nAndrew attended [[Meredith Grey|Meredith's]] anatomy class.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], 12x01</ref>\n\n===[[Jade Bell]]===\nWhen Jade Bell collapsed and came to the hospital, Andrew wanted to page neuro after they stitched up her head. Later, when she collapsed in the hospital, Andrew was quick to take a door off its hinges to use as a backboard.<ref>[[Walking Tall]], 12x02</ref>\n\n===Communication Training===\nSeeing that the interns weren't well-trained in delivering bad news to patient families, [[Owen Hunt]] insisted that they all be trained. He taught them the four Ls (Location, language, body language, and leave) and informed them that they'd be telling the families of the people who died in the ER that day.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], 12x04</ref>\n\n===Beating by Alex Karev===\nWhen Andrew was helping Jo get into bed after a night of drinking, Alex walked in and saw Andrew on top of her. Assuming that Andrew was sexually assaulting her, Alex violently physically assaulted Andrew, leading to the former temporarily injuring his hand and the latter sustaining several critical injuries.<ref>[[Family Affair]], 12x24</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew decided to press charges, Alex and his attorney thought it was for a misdemeanor, but quickly learned that the state had upped the charge to felony assault. Alex pled not guilty.\n\nLater, Alex went to the District Attorney's office to take a plea deal, but Andrew unexpectedly walked in and tried to drop all charges against Alex. When he was told that since the case belonged to the state, he could not do that, he threatened to sabotage the case, which the attorney said was \"a slam dunk.\" Andrew walked out before Alex could understand why he decided to drop the charges. The two eventually had a conversation outside of the hospital in which Andrew says that he did it to protect Jo, and expressed frustration that Alex never apologized when he had the chance.\n\n===Teaming Up with Amelia and Reconnecting with Sam===\nAndrew grew concerned over Amelia when he witnessed her diving into [[Beau Martinez|Beau Martinez']] case and ignoring Owen and Megan. He tried to voice those concerns to Jo at Joe's, but she thought he wanted to talk about the two of them dating. He then left the bar and went home, where he found his sister about to have sex with Arizona.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], 14x01</ref> After arguing in Italian, Andrew decided he would sleep at the hospital. Carina, knowing that Andrew worked for a female chief of surgery, asked him to introduce her to Bailey and got permission from her to conduct research for her study involving scanning the female orgasm using an MRI at Grey Sloan. Andrew tried to talk Amelia out of operating on Beau given the fact that it could cause more harm, but she persisted.\n[[File:14x02-12.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Carina show Amelia her tumor.]]\nDuring the surgery, Amelia made Andrew get Jackson, forcing him to help despite his refusal to participate in the risky surgery earlier. Afterwards, Jackson told them they got lucky when the surgery turned out successful. Later, when Andrew went to talk to Carina about conducting her research at the hospital he worked at, they found that the current study subject had a brain tumor in her frontal lobe. It was Amelia's.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], 14x02</ref>\n[[File:14x03-16.jpg|thumb|Andrew has to keep Amelia's tumor a secret while she and Tom plan its removal.]]\nFor a week, Amelia told Andrew to keep her tumor a secret, which he felt uncomfortable about doing. Amelia called her old teacher, [[Tom Koracick]], to come and perform the surgery. While Amelia had another scan, she directed Andrew to gather all of her recent case files for her to go over in case any mistakes were made on her part. Later, Andrew tried to tell Maggie about the tumor by talking to her about their failed relationship in a room with Amelia's brain scans shown throughout the room, hoping Maggie would notice, but she did not. Later, Amelia told her herself.<ref>[[Go Big or Go Home]], 14x03</ref>\n\nDuring Amelia's surgery, Andrew assisted Koracick with the removal of the tumor. Prior to the surgery, Andrew, Amelia, and Tom did the superhero pose together. He tried to ask questions about the procedure, which Amelia had suggested to make Koracick work faster, but he was ignored by Koracick, who was singing to music while operating and told Andrew to either sing or shut up. The surgery was successful and during her recovery, Andrew used early ambulation on Amelia.\n[[File:14x04-21.jpg|thumb|Andrew checks on Amelia as she recovers.]]\nKoracick tried to order Andrew to stop as he witnessed her struggle, but Andrew continued, saying that this was Amelia's treatment and that she had ordered him to do it no matter what and to ignore Koracick if he told him to stop. Koracick told Andrew that if anything happened, it was his fault. After Amelia recovered, she asked Andrew to run more scans, because she felt that there was something wrong. To ease her concerns, Andrew brought Amelia the removed tumor and showed it to her. He told her that the reason why she felt something was wrong was because for a long time, there was in fact something wrong, but now there wasn't anymore and that, for her, could feel wrong. She realized he was right and hugged him.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], 14x04</ref>\n[[File:14x06-18.jpg|thumb|Andrew joins the other men to hang out on Jackson's boat.]]\nJackson invited Andrew to come hang with him and the other men on his newly purchased boat. He asked Andrew to pick up food since they would be grilling. Andrew met them on the boat with several big fish. Jackson organized a fish filleting contest, which Andrew turned out to be good, as he had learned it from his father when he took him and Carina fishing. When Jackson brought up his new apartment, Andrew said he would be looking for a place soon with Sofia moving back to Seattle. Owen then invited him to come live with him for a while. Soon after, the attendings were paged for the intern mixer, leaving Andrew to clean up their mess. Afterwards, he went to the hospital and found Arizona. He told her he would be staying with Owen, after which they saw Carina and Owen kiss. He couldn't believe she was sleeping with another friend of his and opted against moving in with Owen. Later, he came across the new batch of interns and learned that his ex-girlfriend [[Sam Bello]] was one of them.<ref>[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]], 14x06</ref>\n\nGiven their tumultuous history, Andrew ignored her at work. When she confronted him about it, he reminded her of their history and said they only hurt each other when they get together. He thought she followed him to Seattle, but she denied that. Sam had to get burn supplies but she didn't know where to get them, so Ben made Andrew show her. They diverted and ended up having sex in the skills lab. They were caught by Bailey and Webber. When Carina found out, she reminded Andrew that he and Sam were not healthy together. He later ran into her in an on-call room. She went to leave, but he stopped her and asked her to swear she hadn't followed him to Seattle. She told him they were bad for each other. However, they ended up making out again.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], 14x07</ref>\n\nThey had sex everywhere in the hospital all the time, so everybody knew. When the hospital was hacked, Richard taught Andrew some old-school tricks to treat his patients without modern technology.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], 14x08</ref> Sam started to spiral when the hackers turned up the heat in the hospital. Richard asked Andrew to keep her away from patients. Andrew tried to recuse himself, so Richard revealed he knew about their sexual relationship. He offered to have sex to calm her down, but she told him he was not a person who calmed her down. She said his distracting her didn't make her feel like the brilliant intern she could be, so she decided no more sex. Later, Amelia invited Andrew to be the new Edwards and she also put Sam on her team when she found out that Sam had written a paper that had impressed Amelia.<ref>[[1-800-799-7233]], 14x09</ref>\n\nShe had them do viability research on five proposed projects for the [[Grey Sloan Surgical Innovation Contest]]. While left alone in the lab, he became distracted by her tongue as she was eating chips, so he retaliated by playing their song. She told him to stop seducing her and quickly left. The next day, they continued and Sam took off her scrub top because reading about neuroscience made her overheat, a fact he remembered well. Amelia then came in and told them to stop the viability studies and instead look into ways to remove gliomas without cutting, as she was looking to cure [[Kimmie Park]]. They found nothing, but Amelia herself came up with the idea to use ultrasound ablation, something that had never been done before in brains. They submitted it as a proposal for the Contest, but it didn't make it to round 2. They resorted to drinking at Joe's to deal with the disappointment.<ref>[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]], 14x12</ref>\n\nAmelia and Alex decided to continue the research, but their approach only led to frying tissue. [[Tom Koracick]] joined the project and commented on Sam being hot. Tom wondered why Amelia was in such a rush to get results. Unaware that Amelia was keeping Tom away from Kimmie, Andrew showed Tom the scans and introduced him to Kimmie. They later adjusted to using multiple beams to come at the tumor from different angles, which still wasn't perfect but seemed to be the right direction to further explore.<ref>[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]], 14x13</ref>\n\nWhile working in the ER, Andrew slipped on a sliced-off ear and hit his head. Amelia had his head scanned and diagnosed a grade 3 concussion, meaning he had to rest with limited stimuli in a patient room. He was only concerned that Sam saw him fall. His peace and quiet was disturbed when Carina and Arizona came to discuss their maternal mortality project in his room. After encouragement from Amelia, Sam went to his room. Before she could confess her love, he told her they were young before, but now they weren't. They were there together and she was never just sex to him. They confessed their mutual love and decided to try to make it work. She climbed into bed with him and they snuggled there, which was witnessed by Amelia as she walked by.<ref>[[Games People Play]], 14x14</ref>\n\nApril fetched Andrew to help her out on trauma certification day. At one point, she made him pretend to be dying. Sam had to work on reviving him and they started arguing. April had been spiraling, so intern Casey sent her on a wild goose chase with fake pages as she was the thing that was endangering his patients the most. In an attempt to keep her calm, Andrew brought up that he heard she cheated on her trauma certification, too. She said she did and then lost a patient mere months later because she didn't know what to do. She then fully lost control of herself. She said you can do everything right and people still die and frantically started to perform CPR on a dummy. Andrew checked if she was okay. Distraught, she called off the exercise and went inside.<ref>[[Caught Somewhere in Time]], 14x16</ref>\n\nWhen the time came to test their perfected ultrasound ablation project on [[Noah Brosniak]], the team was very nervous as they were unsure if it would work as they hoped. To calm Amelia down, Andrew initiated the superhero pose. The procedure took a long time because heat built up inside Noah's skull with nowhere to disperse, so they had to wait regularly to let it all cool down. After finishing, Amelia went to throw up and Andrew checked on her. While waiting for Noah to wake up, Andrew and Sam went to sleep in an on-call room. Upon waking up, they realized they had spent their night together again and she wondered about his place. She looked around and discovered a box of his stuff. She realized he was living there. He said he was in between places and she invited him to come live with her.<ref>[[Hold Back the River]], 14x18</ref>\n[[File:14x19-17.jpg|thumb|Andrew thinks Carina called ICE on Sam.]]\n[[File:14x19-19.jpg|thumb|Andrew comforts Sam as she faces deportation.]]\nHe did move in with her. As they arrived at the hospital together, Carina mocked them for playing house, but he bounced back that he was in a monogamous relationship that had lasted longer than any of hers. Later, Taryn came to get Andrew for Meredith. He was told that ICE was looking for Sam to deport her back to El Salvador despite her not having been there since she was one year old and not knowing anyone there. She was there under DACA, but she was caught running a red light, which was apparently reason enough for her to be deported. Meredith suggested a greencard marriage. Andrew was open to the idea, but Sam remembered it wouldn't get her legal status, so they thought about other options. Andrew thought Carina had called ICE on Sam and went to confront her, but she said she would never do that to him or Sam. Andrew returned to the OR where they making plans for Sam and suggested they run away to Canada, but Meredith said ICE was treating her as if she snuck into the country illegally and that they couldn't let her become what they were trying to make her be.\n\nMeredith came up with the idea to send Sam to Switzerland to work under [[Cristina Yang]] as Sam's level of medical training would transfer and provided her with a fake application dated back a year. Sam accepted. They said goodbye as the cab arrived at the hospital. He wanted to follow her to Switzerland as soon as he could, but she didn't want him to throw his life away just because she had to. She then confessed she had in fact followed him to Seattle. She told him they didn't work even if they did. After a last kiss, she left for the airport. Maggie came out to comfort Andrew, but he ignored her and went back inside.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], 14x19</ref>\n\nAndrew was one of the doctors who ate weed cookies. Arizona took him and Maggie into a skills lab so they could wait for the weed to wear off. He lied down on the ground and hallucinated Sam lying with him. After he spent the better part of the day smiling at the hallucination, he tried to reach out, but his hand went right through her. He started sobbing. Maggie took pity on him and took him back to her house. He got comfortable on the couch and she covered him up with a blanket.<ref>[[Judgment Day]], 14x20</ref> He stayed at the house and called in sick to work. He just played some guitar, sang songs he made up, and neglected to shower. He slept while Maggie cooked for them. Meredith tried to get Arizona to talk some sense into him, but Arizona got Carina to do it. Carina accompanied Meredith to her house and yelled at him about his behavior, which would make their father ashamed.<ref>[[Bad Reputation]], 14x21</ref> On his first day back, he was acting tough with the interns, so Maggie invited him on her case to cheer him up. He assisted her and Arizona as they performed a spina bifida surgery on an exteriorized uterus.<ref>[[Fight For Your Mind]], 14x22</ref>\n\nWhen [[Nicole Herman]] returned to the hospital with headaches, Andrew assisted Amelia to find the cause. Amelia was afraid she would have to tell Nicole about her own tumor if Nicole's tumor had grown back. Since the scans were clear, Andrew performed a spinal tap, which led them to diagnose a spinal fluid leak. They only needed to place a shunt to fix that.<ref>[[Cold as Ice]], 14x23</ref>\n\n===Falling for Meredith and Father Issues===\nAndrew got drunk at Jo and Alex's wedding with the interns. While the guests were waiting for the officiant, the wedding planner tried to fill up the time with a toast. She passed the mic to Andrew, who talked about how he viewed Jo and Alex as family since blood had been spilled between them. He talked about how have to celebrate true love before it's ripped from your claws. Meredith noticed he was spiraling and cut in to take him for a walk. She told him she knew what it was like to lose your love, but he was young and handsome, so he would find love again. She reminded him to look forward. He then leaned in and kissed her. She stopped it and said she was not seducing him. He thought he would be fired, but she was just flattered. They then found Alex and Jo trapped in a shed and freed them.\n[[File:14x24-77.jpg|thumb|Andrew is among the guests for Jo and Alex's impromptu ferry wedding.]]\nThe ceremony was called off because of all the things that had gone wrong, including the wedding planner having an allergic reaction, so all guests boarded the ferry back to the city. Meredith officiated an impromptu wedding for the couple on the ferry.<ref>[[All of Me]], 14x24</ref>\n\nAndrew slept off his hangover on Maggie and Jackson's couch. He wanted to call in sick, but Jackson made him walk to work with them. While walking, Andrew remembered he had kissed Meredith and he felt horrified. He noticed a car speeding towards the crosswalk and he pulled Maggie and Jackson out of harm's way. The car did hit [[Nisha]]. Andrew called an ambulance and Jackson thanked him for saving their lives. At the hospital, he went to Meredith and apologized for kissing her. He promised it wouldn't happen again, but unbeknownst to him, she had been having sex dreams about him. In the OR, Vik made a bottle of hair product stuck inside a man's rectum explode by cauterizing a bleeding in the area around it. The bottle shot around the OR and hit Vik, whose sleeve caught on fire. Andrew reacted quickly and extinguished the flames. Vik thanked him for saving his life. Andrew and Richard failed to resuscitate the patient.<ref>[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]], 15x01</ref> The high of saving three lives in one day got Andrew out the slump he'd been in since Sam's departure and he wanted to get back at saving lives. His renewed lust for life led him to buy a motorcycle from a patient after he had had an accident with it. After testing it out, he offered Richard to take a ride.<ref>[[Broken Together]], 15x02</ref>\n[[File:15x03-57.jpg|thumb|Andrew's motorcycle attracts attention from the sisters.]]\nHis motorcycle attracted attention from Maggie, Meredith, and Amelia. Maggie tried to set him up with Amelia in an attempt to get her to leave Owen before Teddy could drop her pregnancy bomb on them, but Amelia wasn't interested. Andrew was surprised she would do that given his history with Maggie, but she said their history was ancient. Meredith then caught his eye, as she had been lingering in his mind since the kiss. That night, Andrew took Link and Richard to Joe's bar.<ref>[[Gut Feeling]], 15x03</ref>\n\nCarina informed Andrew she would be returning to Italy because there was something going on with their father. She only told him he was not dying, but didn't elaborate further. They came across Meredith, who was dressed up for a date, and Andrew was stunned by her beauty. Andrew, Maggie, and Bailey treated [[Natalie Forrester]], who was rapidly declining. [[Evan Forrester]] tried to keep her impending death from their son [[Max Forrester|Max]], but he had noticed that she wasn't doing well. Andrew took him to the helipad to distract him. Andrew shared with him the story of his mother's death to illustrate that the truth can be scary, but Max only took away from it that his father was lying to him about his mother's death. Max then ran off. Andrew chased after him. While he was looking for Max around the hospital, he came across Carina and told her she was a good sister.<ref>[[Momma Knows Best]], 15x04</ref> Andrew and Maggie joined Station 19's search efforts and he was impressed with their work. When the rescue was over, he gave a firefighter's number to Vic, who had been quite hostile towards him for tagging along against protocol.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], 2x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen Owen was out for the day, Richard took charge in the ER and presented Andrew with the opportunity to watch over the interns there. Richard checked in on them stitching up several lacerations and pointed out that Levi needed some pointers, which Andrew then provided. Richard told him he should have noticed that himself and told him to take initiative. Later, a patient needed to be intubated. Levi went to get Richard, but Andrew had done it himself without accepting any help from Taryn by the time he arrived. Richard reminded him they were a teaching hospital. Andrew thought Richard had a problem with him, but Richard said it was the contrary. He needed doctors who not only give the best care but also teach others to do the same, and he saw potential for that in Andrew. After work, Andrew, Link, and Richard went to Joe's again to play guitar and sing.<ref>[[Everyday Angel]], 15x05</ref>\n\nAndrew was supposed to operate on [[Flor Medina]] with Meredith and Alex, but when he discovered that Flor had a little crush on him and preferred he didn't operate on her, he decided to sit the surgery out. He told Meredith he really wanted to work with her, but she said there would be more chances for that in the future. Andrew checked in on Flor after the surgery and sat with her. She asked about some of his favorite things and if he had a girlfriend. He told her he did not have one.\n[[File:15x06-12.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Link both express interest in Meredith.]]\nAfterwards, he ran into Meredith and complimented her on the flower tucked behind her ear. They exchanged some banter about his post-op \"date\" with Flor and he asked about her date, which had been set up by [[Cece Colvin]]. She told him she had scared the guy off. The elevator then arrived and both Andrew and Link held the doors open for her. Confused by their sudden chivalry, she decided to take the stairs.<ref>[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]], 15x06</ref>\n\nAndrew was put on Cece's case as she started to deteriorate. A patient who got injured in the windstorm proved a perfect match for her. They went to tell Cece and Andrew told her she was only getting this organ because the storm was preventing UNOS from sending the organ anywhere else. He stressed that she was in a bad condition and the chances were real that she would not make it off the table. Nevertheless, Cece accepted the organs and urged Meredith to squeeze all the joy she could out of the life she had been given. Afterwards, Andrew overheard that Meredith accepted Link's invitation for drinks that night. Andrew then found Meredith in the scan room and apologized for having been so blunt with Cece. She called him brave for doing that. He then told her that she had been on his mind since the kiss and that he wanted her to know he was one of her options. He said he was a senior resident, so it wouldn't be an abuse of power, and added that Maggie didn't mind, either. She could make up all the excuses, but he said there was something undeniable between them. They almost kissed, but Meredith said she didn't trust herself. She promised to think about what he had said and left. They later ended up on an elevator together on their way to the OR for Cece. A power outage had the elevator trapped between floors and left them stuck together.<ref>[[Blowin' in the Wind]], 15x08</ref>\n[[File:15x09-1.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith bond while stuck in an elevator.]]\n[[File:15x09-11.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Link both ask Meredith out on a date.]]\nNeither of them had a signal. He likened their situation to being in the TARDIS, where time and space and the rules don't apply, but she said the rules still applied. They sat down and she asked him about moving to Italy, promising it would stay between them. In Italian, he shared the story of why his mother and father split up. He then tried to lift her up to the trap door, but she couldn't reach it. She dropped back into his arms and their lips nearly touched. He asked why them kissing would be so bad. She repeated she was his superior and that she was trying to learn from her past mistakes. In Italian, he told her about how badly he wanted to kiss her. She revealed she had taken Italian in college and had therefor understood every word. As they leaned in and nearly kissed, the elevator started working again. The doors opened and she rushed to the OR. She lost Cece in the OR and ran into Andrew after getting off the elevator. He joked she didn't seem to learn from her mistakes as she still used the elevator. She commented on his cocky behavior and he asked her out on a date. Link then came up to ask her the same question. She felt haunted by Cece's ghost and went home to her children without giving an answer to either of them.<ref>[[Shelter from the Storm]], 15x09</ref>\n\nWhenever they operated together, Andrew would observe Meredith closely and try to seduce her. On another case, Andrew had to step up to perform an emergent subtotal colectomy when Owen was accidentally paralyzed by the anesthesiologist. Alex later checked in and told him he had done a great job. On a high, Andrew sent Meredith a text to come celebrate his flying solo with him, but she was getting to know Link at her son's birthday party and ignored him.<ref>[[Help, I'm Alive]], 15x10</ref>\n\nAndrew again tried his luck on Christmas Eve and asked Meredith out for a drink, but she was heading home to put her kids to bed so Santa could come. She did, however, invite him to join her to Jo and Alex's NYE party. After they checked on [[Natasha Deon]] and witnessed Meredith talk to Link, Andrew asked her when she was going to stop stringing Link along and giving him false hope. Meredith wasn't sure it was false hope. Andrew was growing tired of wasting time not being with her. He thought she wasn't brave enough to choose him and asked if the NYE party was a date or if she'd ignore him there. She confirmed it was a date. However, she chose to stay with Natasha and [[Garrett Boland|Garrett]] and stood up both Andrew and Link.\n[[File:15x12-6.jpg|thumb|Andrew confronts Meredith with her behavior towards him.]]\nHe was angry with her and she apologized but said she had a patient. He told her she also had a phone and that she was just rude to treat him like a doormat. While doing another surgery on Natasha, Levi came out as gay and said he had found someone who made him happy. Andrew said life's too short not to share it with someone who lights up your world, not so subtly hinting at Meredith that he wanted to be with her. On Valentine's Day, Natasha's condition had become dire, but Meredith urged Garrett not to give up. Andrew later questioned how she could tell Garrett that if she herself kept running away from love. He used to think she was so beyond him, but he had changed his mind about that. He called her a kid hiding behind excuses like her job and her family. Meredith then turned around and asked Link out on a date. Andrew was later present when Meredith officiated a wedding between a dying Natasha and Garrett. Afterwards, Andrew took Meredith up the roof for a spontaneous date with champagne. They made a toast to Garrett and Natasha. She decided not to go on her date with Link and shared her first real kiss with Andrew.<ref>[[Girlfriend in a Coma]], 15x12</ref>\n\nMeredith refused to let Andrew take her on a real date until she had cleared it with Maggie, so he resorted to buying her coffee and staring at her longingly at work. She took him aside and told him to quit the staring as it was distracting her. At the end of the day, Meredith paged Andrew to a lounge. She had been given Maggie's blessing and decided she would take him out as she didn't want to sit on the back of his motorcycle. He agreed to the plan but only if it could be his treat. They shared a kiss and left holding hands.<ref>[[I Walk the Line]], 15x13</ref>\n\nAndrew assisted Meredith while she was breaking the hospital's longest surgery record. He distracted her when she needed him to by telling a story of the time when, as a kid, he believed that he had broken the record of most rollercoaster rides in one day. After the surgery, Andrew found her sleeping on a gurney in a hallway. He transferred her to a bed in an empty room and left her to sleep.<ref>[[I Want a New Drug]], 15x14</ref>\n[[File:15x15-11.jpg|thumb|Andrew and Meredith kiss before heading into the party.]]\n[[File:15x15-24.jpg|thumb|Meredith and Andrew realized they caused the \"fire.\"]]\nOn the day of Catherine's party, Meredith informed Chief Karev of their relationship. They went to the party together, but as they had her house to themselves, they didn't plan on staying long. However, Meredith got sucked into Amelia's drama with Owen, preventing them from leaving soon. As Amelia was planning to come sleep at the house, Meredith and Andrew resorted to making out in the guest room. He got a call from Carina, but he declined it to keep on kissing his girlfriend. They were caught by Richard, who awkwardly left. They went back downstairs to the party and, in an attempt to act normal, took over from the catering staff. They put a tray of egg rolls in the oven. The tray was made out of plastic and caused the entire apartment to fill with smoke. Everyone was evacuated. While out on the street, they decided to go to Andrew's place to avoid any further distractions. However, as they arrived there, so did Carina and Vincenzo, their father. He greeted his son and Andrew introduced Meredith to him.<ref>[[We Didn't Start the Fire]], 15x15</ref>\n\nThe siblings caught up and Andrew found out that his father had come here to pitch medical research. He seemed stable to him while Carina insisted he was bipolar. He briefly visited Meredith in her lab for a kiss and then joined his family for the research pitch to Alex. Vincenzo was looking for funding for external gestational research, which he had already gotten to the stage of animal trials. After 125 days, a healthy sheep was born. Alex asked for some time to consider. Andrew and Vincenzo then got coffee. Vincenzo told him he was hoping they could make up for the time they had lost because his controlling mother had come between them. He assured Andrew that the research would put him on the map so that Meredith wouldn't be beyond him anymore.\n[[File:15x16-3.jpg|thumb|Andrew asks Meredith to trust his judgment about his father.]]\nLater, Meredith found Andrew and Carina arguing. Andrew had decided to sign on for the research, while Carina insisted their father wasn't well. She stated she knew their father better than Andrew did and that their father knew how to manipulate Andrew into doing his bidding. Meredith had her doubts, knowing full well how clouded one's judgment can get, but Andrew was sure on the matter and asked her to trust him on it. Alex decided to fund the research. Before helping their father set up in the lab, the siblings met outside. Still on the fence about it herself, Carina hoped Andrew was right about this.<ref>[[Blood and Water]], 15x16</ref>\n[[File:15x17-3.jpg|thumb|Andrew wakes up in the lab.]]\n[[File:15x17-27.jpg|thumb|Carina and her father have a fight.]]\nAndrew spent all his time on the research and even spent nights in the lab to monitor the lambs. Meredith brought him coffee as a peace offering to apologize for her suspicions about his dad. He appreciated that and invited her to spend a night at his place if were to spend it there himself. She accepted and went to work. That morning, a lamb died and an argument erupted between Carina and Vincenzo, who threw the former off the study. Alex had them write a report on the matter so he could review it. Carina pleaded with Andrew to see their father's illness, but Andrew insisted he was fine. Carina thought the project was too important to let it be ruined by their father. Andrew insisted she didn't have the right degree to diagnose him and that she always butted heads with their father like this. While continuing the work, Andrew told his father to control his tantrums because they didn't help their credibility. They discussed Carina backing out and Vincenzo wanted to reach out to make peace, but Andrew told him that she was occupied with a trauma patient who might lose her baby. Vincenzo went behind everyone's backs and pitched his research as a solution to the couple. He was scolded by Alex, but Vincenzo couldn't understand that it was way too soon for human trials.\n\nAndrew then finally saw the truth, but Vincenzo remained unbothered, stating he was the only one willing to do what it took to save that baby. Andrew realized it was just like that night when he insisted on saving those seven people by himself. Andrew told him that letting the baby die now was merciful compared to letting it die in a bag by the hands of a mad scientist who didn't know what he was doing, but Vincenzo did not agree. Alex then gathered the DeLucas in his office and announced he was pulling the funding. Infuriated and unwilling to let someone take over, Vincenzo packed up his stuff and moved his research back to Italy. Meredith visited Andrew as he was cleaning out the lab and he lashed out at her. She stated she would never tell she had been right. He apologized and said he shouldn't be around people. She told him to let her know if he needed anything and left.<ref>[[And Dream of Sheep]], 15x17</ref>\n\nAndrew continued to keep his distance from Meredith. Andrew got put on Alex's service for a total pancreatectomy. The surgery was cancelled because the girl's labs showed a high glycemia. Alex told Andrew he was sorry about the cancellation. Suspecting Meredith had pulled strings to cheer him up, Andrew yelled that he didn't need any favors from him. Later, the doctors discovered that the girl had sabotaged her surgery by drinking juice. They found out she didn't want the surgery because then she would have to go back to school, where she was bullied. Andrew pushed the mother too hard to convince her daughter to get the surgery, so Alex threw him off the case. Andrew then went to talk to the girl behind Alex's back and shared how he had survived being bullied himself. Alex then performed the surgery without Andrew to punish him for disobeying him. Later, Andrew yelled at Alex for being unprofessional, but Alex told him that he was the unprofessional. He should have talked to Nora first before going at her mother like he did. Alex understood parents can do a number on their kids, but Andrew let it interfere with his job and his relationship today. Alex also told him not to bite people's hand when they reach out, because then they stop doing so. That night, Meredith visited him at home and told him she was past the time of wondering if her boyfriend was ignoring her. Andrew understood and said it hurt him that he was unable to help his father, so he needed some time to hurt and he didn't want to drag her down with him. Now he was ready to let her back in. He cooked them dinner and they enjoyed each other's company.<ref>[[Add It Up]], 15x18</ref>\n\nRichard scheduled a solo lap appy for Andrew. Andrew examined the patient, who complimented him on his looks in front of Richard. She then asked Andrew to check out her Instagram. Richard told him it was part of the job so Andrew complied and listened to the patient talk about crossfit. In surgery, Richard asked about the long-term plan. Andrew thought he was talking about his relationship with Meredith and said they hadn't discussed it yet. He said he respected where Meredith came from and that she was amazing to him. Richard then said he meant Andrew's career. Andrew said he was attracted to general surgery. The surgery had to be converted to an open procedure when they came across dead bowel. Richard wanted to take over, but Andrew knew the steps of an ileocecectomy and pulled it off. Once Andrew was done, Richard complimented Andrew and said he'd put in a good word with the head of general surgery. That night, Meredith and Andrew had dinner at his place again and he talked her through his day.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], 15x20</ref>\n\nAs their relationship progressed, they also had sex at Meredith's house, but she wouldn't allow him to sleep over yet. One night, when he was sneaking out, he ran into Zola as she was getting some water from the kitchen. He returned to Meredith to tell her about it. She hated that her plan on how to tell them was now ruined, but he was just glad she had been planning to do so. She then checked if the coast was clear before sending him out again. Later at work, Meredith told him Zola appeared to be fine and she asked if he liked kids. He did, citing his 16 first cousins whom he all adored. Later, Meredith and Andrew had to deliver a baby of a woman who didn't know she was pregnant. Meredith later watched Andrew hold the baby in the woman's room, which convinced her to tell her kids about him.<ref>[[Head Over High Heels]], 15x22</ref>\n\n===Meredith's Insurance Fraud and Relationship Fall-Out===\nWhile working in the clinic, Andrew encountered [[Gabriella Rivera|Gabriella]] and her father [[Luis Rivera]]. Luis had come to the U.S. on a visa and applied for asylum. He sent for his family once he had an apartment, but they were detained and separated at the border. Gabby had just arrived in Seattle with severe abdominal pain, having received little medical care while in detention. She was diagnosed with an obstruction and required surgery, for which Luis couldn't pay. Andrew took him to fill out forms to apply for state coverage, but it was denied because he made too much money cleaning offices. Meredith, who had joined the case, promised that she had a plan, which turned out to be filling out Ellis's name on the paperwork so they could benefit from her insurance. She knew it was wrong, but insisted that she was trying to remedy something even more wrong. However, in surgery, it was discovered that the obstruction was caused by a lymphoma, meaning the case wouldn't be over with just the one surgery. Andrew stood by as Meredith and Richard decided to make Gabby sicker on paper and keep her hospitalized for 30 days so that a new state policy would kick in, which was regardless of income. Throughout the day, Andrew had been quiet, so Meredith assumed he disapproved of her actions. However, he was actually in awe of her. He told her he could have been Gabby when he had come here from Italy and he loved that she didn't look away from the situation like so many people do. He had been quiet because he was afraid he'd tell her that he loved her if he opened his mouth. Taken aback, she told him she was glad they had cleared that up and quickly left.<ref>[[What I Did for Love]], 15x23</ref>\n\nAndrew spent the night in a chair next to Gabby's bed. She woke him up by throwing her stuffed animals at him. Later, when she admitted to being scared of the MRI, he took her there to take a scan of one of her stuffed animals to show her how it worked. Alex walked in as he was doing so and hinted to a career in peds. Later, Andrew met Jo and Meredith outside of the conference room where Bailey and Catherine had been holed up all day. Meredith asked him to look after Jo while she went off to look for Alex. Jo brought up his love confession to Meredith, but he was soon paged to the room by Bailey.\n[[File:15x24-14.jpg|thumb|Andrew takes the fall for Meredith.]]\nInside, he was informed that the insurance company had discovered the insurance fraud. Andrew took the fall for Meredith. Before he was arrested, he was allowed to go inform Meredith, who was stuck inside the pressurized hyperbaric chamber, of what he had done. He told her he had lied to her about Gabby having insurance and he apologized for using her daughter's name. He said what he did wasn't fair to her or her kids, who needed her. Meredith realized what he was doing and begged him not to, but his mind was made up and he was taken away by Catherine.<ref>[[Drawn to the Blood]], 15x24</ref>\n\nAndrew was arrested and escorted out of the hospital. Meredith later visited him in jail and told him his move was stupid, stating he would lose his license. He said he was called into a room and asked for details and he couldn't bring himself to turn her in. She told him that he needed to develop some instincts for self-preservation if they were going to be together. She wanted to clean up her own messes and live in her truth, because what she was trying to remedy was so much more wrong than what she did. Meredith then told him she was going to turn herself in to get it out. She admitted she felt terrified. She stated she loved him, too, and then walked out to go turn herself in.<ref>[[Jump Into the Fog]], 15x25</ref>\n\nMeredith came clean and the charges against Andrew were dismissed. He sat in her corner during her meeting, where she confessed to not really regretting her actions, instead blaming the system, which landed her with court-ordered community service to pick up trash on the streets. He then returned to work with a cocky attitude to Bailey, knowing she was in need of help. He was put on the case of [[Jai Prishna]]. He convinced Jai's wife Mari not to give up hope just yet despite Jai living his worst nightmare of being hooked to machines. He promised to tell her when it was time to give up hope, but a week later, Jai recovered without deficits. After a few weeks of community service, Meredith ate ice cream with Andrew and told him that word of her community service got out at Zola's school, but she didn't care because she and her kids were healthy and she had found some sense of accomplishment in the work. As he joked about robbing a store to get some roadside vacation himself, her happiness disappeared when she found out that the medical board was pursuing action against her license.<ref>[[Nothing Left to Cling To]], 16x01</ref>\n\nAndrew was dropping Meredith off for her community service when she found out that her medical license hearing was in three months. With the other residents, Andrew partook in Bailey's skills lab on the axillary-bifemoral bypass for [[Wade Foltz]], where he pointed out she was using different grafts than Meredith. He finished first in the skills lab but while Bailey had promised that the first one to finish would get to do the anastomosis, she chose Taryn instead, who had finished mere seconds after him. She did allow him to scrub in with them. When there was a bleeding from Taryn's suture line, Bailey had Andrew step in to fix it. Wade was fine in post-op. Andrew confronted Bailey with her choosing Taryn while he should have been the one to do that part of the surgery. He suggested she had sidelined him because of his relationship with Meredith. She warned him not to question her methods, as Taryn needed to experience the adrenaline and fear that makes you a surgeon, and told him not to make this personal. She suggested he started thinking about his career and let go of certain loyalties. After work at Meredith's, he was told by Meredith that she was going to write an article about the brokenness of the medical system after all the problems she had seen while on community service.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], 16x02</ref>\n\nWhile dropping Meredith off again, she told him she had gotten in touch with a website that was interested in publishing her article on the medical system. She listed some ideas she had, all of which would rub the medical community the wrong way. She didn't care since they were already in a fight anyway. At work, Andrew had to take responsibility and face Bailey's anger when Levi let a catheter guide wire slip into a patient under his supervision. They managed to save the patient in the cath lab. Afterwards, Andrew had Levi tell the patient's family but he had to take over as Levi was being too elaborate with needless details. At home, he told Meredith about it while having Link and Amelia over. The pair came to share the news that she was pregnant. Andrew congratulated them.<ref>[[Reunited]], 16x03</ref>\n\nMuch to her surprise, the website had pulled all of Meredith's ideas into one article that trashed Grey Sloan instead of the medical system itself. Andrew noticed the residents were panicking about the effect that would have on their future careers but they tried to shut him out because of his involvement with Meredith. He went to see Bailey and told him there were also some scheduling conflicts, which the Chief Resident couldn't resolve since she quit over the article. Bailey then appointed him Chief Resident and told him to go fix the mess his girlfriend had made. Andrew let Meredith know how mad Bailey was. In the evening, he came across Meredith in the hospital and learned she had tried to explain the situation to Bailey, which didn't go well, and that she got a summons to court since her supervisor had informed the judge that she had walked out on work crew. Andrew hated that she made a choice that could land her in jail and was actively adding to the threat of her losing her license. He wanted her to lay low, do her hours, and return to work to change the system from within. She pointed out nothing she wrote was a lie and refused to sit on her mountain of privilege and let other people fight their own battles. She grew upset and told him that if he really expected her to sit back and let people be hurt and killed by the broken system, he didn't know her at all.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], 16x04</ref>\n\nTom put Andrew on his service to get him to make Meredith make things right with Grey Sloan. He suggested withholding sex but Andrew said that wouldn't work on her. Meredith then appeared with a sick Zola and asked Tom to do a head CT. The CT revealed her shunt needed to be revised. Since she was supposed to appear before the judge that day, Andrew told Meredith he would keep an eye out for Zola so she could go, which angered her. He also offered to sit with Meredith during the surgery but she also hated that he was offering to skip out on surgeries in his residency just to be her human tissue. The surgery went well and Meredith had him to stay with Zola in post-op. In the evening, she ran into him when she went out to look for Jello for her daughter. Andrew had anticipated that request and handed her a cup. Meredith's lawyer then came up and informed them that she would have to make up the hours she skipped out on community service in jail.<ref>[[Breathe Again]], 16x05</ref>\n\nOn Halloween, while Meredith was in jail, Andrew came to pick up the kids to drive them to school. He wanted to help Zola out with her costume wings but she rejected his help, telling him he was not her father. While working together with Jackson, Jackson inquired about Meredith. Andrew admitted he didn't really know how she was doing as her eight allowed minutes of phone time mostly went to him telling her about her kids. He explained he was helping out and told him about Zola's reaction. Jackson said that with kids, there's almost always a reason for such behavior. During rounds, Maggie came to drop off Zola with him as she had a surgery and Zola was refusing to go to daycare. Zola read her book while Andrew rounded on his patients but eventually discovered that she has disappeared from her chair. He found her in the gallery and asked her if he did anything wrong that morning. She didn't like it when people touched her wings because her dad fixed them before he died. She admitted she was scared she was going to forget him. Andrew assured her that wouldn't happen as Derek was such a legend that people would keep talking about him, which is how Andrew himself learned a lot about him. He told her the story of how her father had saved [[Isaac (Season 6)|Isaac]], which made Zola warm up to him again. They went trick-or-treating together. While they were sorting out the candy, Meredith came home from jail. He shortly greeted her while she hugged her kids, whom he took back to sorting the candy while Meredith spoke to her sisters.<ref>[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]], 16x06</ref>\n\nAndrew accompanied Meredith, her sisters, and Alex to the hotel for her hearing before the medical commission. Andrew was called to testify and questioned about when he had found out about the fraud. He said he hadn't until Richard did. The panel knew about his and Meredith's relationship through documentation from HR. Andrew assured them that the relationship was consensual and that Meredith hadn't forced him to keep the fraud quiet. He was also questioned about paperwork that detailed his being mistreated by attendings, including Meredith, after being assaulted by Alex. Andrew said that was ancient history and apologized to Meredith for hurting her case but she told him it was okay. During a short recess, Andrew and Meredith sat down and she told him their relationship wouldn't survive if she were to lose her license while he would still get to cut. Andrew followed the hearing, which ended with Meredith getting to keep her license. Andrew briefly hugged her but then disappeared as she turned to her other colleagues. He visited her at home and asked to talk. She apologized to him for what she had said but he knew she had meant it. He told her he stood up for her in court and the hospital and went to jail for her because he loved her. The whole experience made him realize that she didn't see him as her partner. When she talked about Derek in that hearing, he finally understood a feeling he had been having for a while, which was that she loved Derek but respected him, too. Meredith said she respected Andrew as well but he knew some part of her wasn't sure if he would ever be on her level. He told her to take some time to figure out what she wanted and whether he was part of that or not.<ref>[[My Shot]], 16x08</ref>\n\nOn her first day back, Andrew was surprised to see her. She told him she had wanted to tell him Bailey had re-hired her but he had been too busy dumping her. He said he didn't dump her but she said it was all the same to her. Together with all the other residents, they started rounds, during which they met [[Cormac Hayes]], the new Head of Pediatric Surgery. While scrubbing in, Andrew told Link and Nico about his inadvertent dumping of Meredith. They pointed out he wasn't her equal and might never be but, given their own relationships, they knew that that didn't mean she didn't respect him. They advised him to go find Meredith and undo what he did. He eventually found her but after watching her for a bit, he just walked off without talking to her.<ref>[[Let's All Go to the Bar]], 16x09</ref>\n\nDespite multiple traumas coming in due to the car crash at Joe's bar, Tom tasked Andrew with babysitting [[Elliott Calhoun]] in the ICU. While doing that, Andrew texted Meredith asking if they could talk later. Elliott's heart then started beating again. Andrew went to find Teddy, who told him to prep Elliott and then she'd join him to take Elliott off ECMO. That went well and Elliott's wife thanked Andrew for saving her husband, though Andrew acknowledged it wasn't actually his doing. Andrew then visited Maggie at home to let her know that Elliott had made it through. She was relieved to hear that. Andrew then asked her for advice on how to deal with issues with Meredith as he meant some of the things of he had said but he realized that asking her to take time was wrong. Maggie only said he had hurt a woman who had been hurt more than enough for a lifetime. Andrew then stood there as she was served with a lawsuit over Sabi's death.<ref>[[Help Me Through the Night]], 16x10</ref>\n\nMeredith came to find Andrew at work and told him she missed him. He reminded her he hadn't broken up with her so she didn't have to miss him. He then told her that [[Suzanne Britland]], his post-op appy patient was inexplicably running fevers. She told him she'd think about it but advised him to take it up to Bailey. They did scans that confirmed Andrew didn't make a mistake during his surgery but didn't give them any pointers as to why Suzanne had also suddenly developed a cardiac tamponade. As they were clueless, Bailey instructed Andrew to create a war room and gather all the people who could help them. Meredith found him there and had him talk her through the entire case.<ref>[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]], 16x11</ref>\n\nThey reconciled while working together closely and Andrew spent the night at her place. Whilst making out with her in the morning, Andrew was paged because Suzanne had been transferred to the CCU. He told her he had used her name to lure [[Lauren Riley]], a diagnostics genius from San Francisco, to help them on the case. Andrew wanted to talk about the status of their relationship but Meredith wanted him to get to Suzanne first. Andrew pressured the residents to work on the case and visited Suzanne, who had found Meredith's hospital from hell article. After Andrew explained the situation, Lauren Riley arrived and explained her method of starting over from the beginning. Outside, Lauren asked Andrew to get Meredith. He claimed she was in surgery but Maggie pointed out she was standing nearby. Meredith's puzzled reaction made Lauren realize that she had been lied to. Andrew begged her to stay, which worked. He watched closely as Maggie, on her first day back, operated on Suzanne. After the surgery, Lauren recommended withdrawing all medication to see if certain symptoms had been masked. She and Andrew presented their idea to Suzanne whilst underlining that Lauren was the best at what she does, with Lauren sharing a story of her own three sisters to ease Hadley and Suzanne's concerns about the hospital. Suzanne then consented. Outside the room, Lauren confessed to Andrew that she was an only child and had lied with ease to get Suzanne to consent.<ref>[[Save the Last Dance for Me]], 16x13</ref>\n\nAs Suzanne's condition worsened over the next three days, Andrew began to question the approach but Lauren insisted. Determined to end Suzanne's suffering, Andrew rudely interrupted a conversation between Meredith and Cormac to ask her about a certain patient from the past with some similar symptoms to Suzanne's. Cormac pointed out his rudeness and left. Both Carina and Meredith noticed how fast Andrew was talking as he explained his query. Concerned, they asked when he had slept last, which he refused to answer to. Lauren then came to inform him the pericardial biopsy came back negative for carcinomatosis. Meredith questioned their progress but Lauren said every diagnosis ruled out was progress. Meredith then pointed out that Andrew was fried and appeared obsessed. Lauren said he knew the case inside out and she was relying on his being obsessed. Suzanne began bleeding from her mouth and Andrew saw that all her blood cell counts had gone down. While performing a bone marrow biopsy, Lauren asked Andrew if he was still sleeping with Meredith. She had observed the way they argued, which made her figure it out. He confessed that he wasn't sure but Lauren said it explained her concern over his wellbeing. Soon after, Bailey called Andrew into her office to inform him that Meredith was taking over Suzanne's case, with the first step being putting her back on her meds. Andrew began objecting, stating he hadn't made any mistakes, but Bailey cut him off before he could say something he would regret later. Just as Lauren was packing up her stuff, with all of her progress being undone, the results of the biopsy came back, which made Lauren diagnose Still's disease. They rushed to her room and injected steroids into Suzanne's IV without informing Meredith of what they were doing. Meredith asked Andrew for a word outside but he ignored her and left.\n\nIt turned out they were right and Suzanne soon felt better. Meredith told Andrew to go into her room so they could thank him, but he snapped that she could go in and take the credit for her patient. He said he saved Suzanne's life no thanks to her. Meredith pointed out his career would have been over if he had been wrong after what he pulled. He asked if she would have given permission. She admitted she would have asked some questions because she didn't think he was in the right state of mind to make life-or-death decision. Andrew insisted it was the right decision. As she said he wasn't acting like himself, he yelled that she was a hypocrite as she never followed rules herself. Having overheard his outburst, Cormac stepped in to stand up for Meredith. Andrew went on to say how he had saved Suzanne's life against all odds. Meredith pointed out he was sounding like his father and told him to get some sleep. Andrew then said he didn't need any of this nor Meredith, so they were done. He walked off to go watch Suzanne being reunited with her kids.<ref>[[A Diagnosis]], 16x14</ref>\n\nAs a blizzard raged over Seattle, Andrew overheard that one of Cormac's patients couldn't get their liver transplant because the liver couldn't be transferred from Seattle Pres to Grey Sloan. Andrew said he would personally get the liver. Meredith tried to talk him out of it, pointing out people were freezing to death, but he brushed it off, saying he was used to the cold. He expected her to bring up his father again and left, going out into the cold to retrieve the liver. He eventually returned with the liver, which he delivered straight to the OR, with frostbitten fingers. Against his wishes, Andrew was brought to a treatment room where Jackson started working on his hands while Andrew and Carina argued over his careless behavior. Andrew wanted to go treat patients but Jackson pointed out he would lose his hands and career if he didn't stay for treatment. Jackson did his best and said the next twelve hours were critical. Carina and Meredith came to his room. Meredith said the child made it. He aggressively said she would be dead if Meredith had had things her way. Carina said they were worried about him. Carina said this was just like when their father started showing symptoms, at the same age as Andrew was now. Andrew's response was throwing Meredith out of his room.<ref>[[Snowblind]], 16x15</ref>\n\nAt odds with Meredith yet again, Andrew had to sit through mandatory therapy with [[Cynthia Cole]], who had to sign off on him before he could operate again. During the session, he insisted he didn't need to be there and denied having experienced any symptoms of mania. He claimed he had just had a stressful couple of weeks but that his behavior had only saved patients' lives. After the session, he went to the ER and fixed the overflow. With Richard having given up his service, he thought that he could help out, but Bailey still forbade him from treating patients. After work, Andrew ran into Jo at the bar and offered her a drink. He suggested that since they were both single now, they could have sex. She threw her drink in his face and told him to get help.<ref>[[Life on Mars?]], 16x17</ref>\n\n=== Aunt Opal and Murder ===\nAndrew examined a teenage patient who came into the clinic under the name [[Erin Banks|Cindy Wright]] with her aunt [[Opal]]. He began to suspect that the \"aunt\" was really a human trafficker due to her always answering questions for the girl and never leaving her side. He brought his concerns to Dr. Bailey who doubted him due to his deteriorating mental health but she still visited the patient herself. She didn't find any cause for concern and took Andrew off the case, telling him to meet her in her office the next morning. However, Andrew was not convinced and took \"Cindy\" up to the surgical floor, where family members are not allowed.\n\nEventually, Andrew and the unsuspecting patient made their way to the waiting room, where a crowd formed as he stood between Opal and Cindy to keep them apart. He frantically asked for security to detain Opal but Dr. Bailey stopped them and Carina begged for him to stop his behavior. He called for everyone to follow protocol and make a human chain around Opal, but instead they exchanged sad looks and formed the chain around him. Opal and Cindy rushed together and comforted each other as Andrew stood on a chair and yelled that Opal was selling people and their affection was a trauma bond, not love. Dr. Bailey tells Andrew to go with security or he will be banned from the hospital, causing him to break down as he realized that no one supported his belief. He went with them and quit his job instead of accepting the suspension that Bailey gave him. Meredith followed him into a stairwell after seeing Dr. Bailey chase after him. He told Meredith that the more he tries to accomplish the impossible and change people's lives, the more he's judged and called crazy. She comforted him and begged for him to take the suspension instead of quitting. They made an agreement that he would as long as Dr. Bailey would call the national trafficking hotline to have them investigate Opal.\n\nShortly afterward, Opal forcefully escorted Cindy out of the emergency room undetected. She thought Cindy said something to Andrew, but Cindy insisted she didn't. Unaware of the pair being gone, Dr. Bailey called the hotline and they told her not to scare Opal off. However, since she had already left, all Dr. Bailey and Meredith could do was hope that Andrew wasn't right.<ref>[[Give a Little Bit]], 16x18</ref>\n\nDespite being placed on leave, Andrew returned unofficially to help diagnose Richard after his public meltdown at a conference. Andrew barely slept during the weeks he researched possible causes with Meredith. He prevented Catherine from her attempt to take Richard home and rushed into the OR when Dr. Bailey was preparing to conduct Richard's nerve biopsy. She tried to kick him out of the room but he knocked over her instrument tray and convinced her to test Richard's blood for cobalt poisoning because of a past hip replacement that could be deteriorating. Andrew's diagnosis was correct and he was allowed to scrub in (but not touch Richard) after Meredith reminded Dr. Bailey that the major save was because of him.<ref>[[Put on a Happy Face]], 16x21</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Andrew entered a severe depressive state. Despite this, he managed to visit Cindy when she came back to the hospital in a worse condition, this time without Opal. He was right about her being a victim of human trafficking and he was the only one she would trust. Andrew comforted her and stayed with her, eventually learning that her real name is Erin Banks. The doctors called the police and informed them. Andrew's depressive episode continued and Richard, Meredith, Bailey, and Carina staged an intervention with the support of his psychiatrist. After being defensive for a moment, he broke down and said his one goal in life was to not end up like his father. He admitted he was not okay but did not know what to do and the group got him to agree to going on medication to help manage his condition.<ref>[[All Tomorrow's Parties]], 17x01</ref> He worked on his mental health after the intervention and his relationships with the group improved, eventually getting involved with Meredith's COVID-19 treatment and supporting Dr. Bailey after her mother's death.\n\nOpal returned to the hospital during the pandemic to check on an accomplice of hers who had been arrested and brought to the hospital after a botched trafficking scheme. Unaware of who she was, Levi noticed her and examined her when she claimed she had been mugged. He brought a police officer to take her statement on the mugging so she made up a story. She left shortly afterward due to the risk of being at Grey-Sloan. Andrew spotted her in the parking lot and enlisted the help of Carina in following Opal so he would not lose her again.<ref>[[No Time for Despair]], 17x06</ref>\n\nWhile trailing Opal through Seattle,  Andrew was stabbed by an unknown assailant. Opal and the attacker were arrested as Andrew was rushed to Grey-Sloan, where he was treated in surgery by Hunt, Altman, and [[Reza Khan|Khan]]. During this time, Andrew was on the beach with Meredith in her dream sequence, where they were able to share some moments together. He told her that he didn't regret following Opal because we go through life ignoring atrocities all the time, but it makes sense to fight for people. Back in the real world, he woke up and Carina told him that the traffickers were arrested so he saved a lot of kids but she was still mad at him. Though the initial surgery was a success, Andrew later suffered a cardiac tamponade and went into DIC, resulting in the need for him to return to surgery. Meanwhile, Meredith and Andrew saw a woman calling to Andrew on the beach: his deceased mother. Andrew said he needed to go and Meredith told him that she would miss him. He ran off to reunite with his mother. At the same time, Khan told Altman, Hunt, and the rest of the surgical team that Andrew\u2019s heart would not restart as he had already been down for forty minutes. They reluctantly stopped and Andrew flatlined. Khan asked if anyone was going to call time of death but was met only with silence and heartbroken looks. He called time of death as 22:50, and Andrew and his mother walked away on the beach, arm in arm.<ref>[[Helplessly Hoping]], 17x07</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nAndrew was very confident and easygoing. He had a strong emotional and soft side, especially when it came to romantic relationships. Sometimes he could make very irrational decisions.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Maggie Pierce]]====\nAfter not being able to save one of the twins, Andrew ended up at the bar getting drunk with Maggie. She kissed him, and they ended up sleeping together.<ref>[[I Choose You]], 12x03</ref> The next day, she avoided him and then told him that it wouldn't be happening again. Despite this, they began kissing and had sex again.<ref>[[Old Time Rock and Roll]], 12x04</ref>\n\n[[File:12x03-25.jpg|thumb|264px|Maggie and Andrew at Joe's bar]]After they had sex, Maggie had the repeated, urgent need to urinate, so she came back to the hospital. Because OB was understaffed, Andrew came in to examine her. She believed he may have given her an STI. After her exam, she and Andrew talked about how he didn't automatically assume that she gave him something, so she shouldn't automatically assume he gave her something and he said that she could get the test results later, but if she wanted to know anything about his history, she could ask or she could just trust him.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], 12x05</ref>\n\nWhen Andrew touched her affectionately while working on a case, Maggie told him he couldn't do that anymore. They needed to keep it professional at work. She admitted to having feelings for him and asked if he could keep it professional at work. He said he could.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], 12x08</ref>\n\nWhen an ambulance exploded in the ER, Maggie repeatedly paged Andrew. He found her and told her she needed to stop paging him so much, but she admitted she was worried about him, believing he'd been in the blast.<ref>[[All I Want is You]], 12x10</ref>\n\nShortly after they went public, Andrew became uncomfortable with the way things changed when people knew he was seeing an attending and he started to avoid her. When she confronted him, he ended things with her.<ref>[[When It Hurts So Bad]], 12x16</ref>\n\n====[[Sam Bello]]====\n[[File:14x18-54.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sam and Andrew at a hospital party]]While the details of Andrew and Sam's relationship are unknown, it is known that they had a very complicated, on-and-off relationship for years. The first time they broke up, he stayed on his sister Carina's couch for weeks. He seemed to dislike having Sam in Seattle and tried his best to ignore and avoid her. After she assured him that she didn't come to Seattle for him, they ended up having sex in an on-call room, despite knowing their relationship wasn't good for either of them.<ref>[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]], 14x07</ref> [[Jo Wilson]] and [[Alex Karev]] discuss that Andrew and Sam continued to do this every day.<ref>[[Out of Nowhere]], 14x08</ref> \n\nThey eventually moved in together as their relationship grew more serious. However, when Sam was discovered by ICE and was in risk of deportation, she decided to continue her medical career in Switzerland under [[Cristina Yang]] and left the country.<ref>[[Beautiful Dreamer]], 14x19</ref> After Andrew and Sam broke up, Andrew went to Meredith Grey's house and stayed on the couch, not able to get over Sam. At Jo and Alex's wedding, he got drunk out of misery, leading him to kiss Meredith.<ref>[[All of Me]], 14x24</ref>\n\n====[[Meredith Grey]]====\nAt Jo and Alex's wedding, Andrew drunkenly kissed Meredith, and she rejected his advances, though she said she was flattered. The next day, Andrew remembered what he did and apologized to Meredith, who, unbeknownst to Andrew, was having sex dreams about him. Andrew soon realized he had feelings for Meredith and tried to keep them in tact while she began dating other people with the help of her matchmaker patient. However, during the superstorm, when Andrew saw that Meredith might start dating [[Atticus Lincoln]], he confessed his feelings for her. Meredith told him she had to think about it, but that same day, they got trapped in the elevator, where they learn more about each other, such as that they both speak Italian. They almost kissed until the elevator began working again.\n\n[[File:15x15-11.jpg|thumb|260px|Meredith and Andrew at Catherine's party]]Now that Meredith was fully aware of Andrew's feelings for her, Andrew began to pursue Meredith in competition with her other suitor, Link. Though Meredith initially tried to resist her interest in Andrew by setting up a date with Link, she eventually chose Andrew to be with, and they shared their first kiss on the hospital roof on Valentine's Day. After getting Maggie's approval, Meredith allowed Andrew to take her out on a date, starting their relationship officially.\n\nWhen operating with Richard on a woman's appendectomy, Andrew told him that, while he and Meredith hadn't had any serious conversations about their future yet, she makes him so happy, earning him Richard's approval on the relationship. After Zola caught Andrew trying to sneak out of Meredith's room in the middle of the night, Meredith asked Andrew if he even liked kids, to which he responded that he has sixteen cousins and that her kids might like him more than her. That night, Meredith told her kids about her relationship with Andrew, which they warmly welcomed.\n\nAfter watching Meredith commit insurance fraud for Gabby Rivera's case, Andrew didn't say anything, but looked like he disapproved as they operated on Gabby. Later that day, Meredith told him that she could not apologize for her actions, as she did them to save a family. Andrew told Meredith that she had it all wrong; he was silent because he was in awe of what she did and that he was worried he would accidentally blurt out that he loves her. Though Meredith didn't say it back at first, she eventually told him she loves him too after he took the fall for the insurance fraud and landed himself in jail.\n\nAfter Meredith's trial, he told her that he saw the way she talked about Derek, and said that she didn't just love Derek, she respected him. Meredith said he couldn't compare the two, but Andrew told her to take some time.\n\nWhen Andrew drove himself sleepless from a patient, Suzanne, Carina voiced her concerns to Meredith that he might have the same mania as their father. Meredith took over Suzanne's case and didn't agree with Andrew's course of treatment. However, his treatment led to the discovery of Suzanne having Still's disease. Andrew was angry with Meredith, since if they had followed her idea, they'd never have diagnosed Suzanne. During their fight, Meredith told him he was acting like his father. This only angered Andrew further, and he ended up breaking up with Meredith completely.\n\n===Familial===\n====[[Carina DeLuca]]====\nAt a young age, he and his mother moved to the United States while his sister, Carina, stayed behind in Italy with their father. Carina came to Seattle to do research about the female orgasm and discovered Amelia's brain tumor. While in Seattle, Carina also served as OB/GYN when needed.\n\n====[[Vincenzo DeLuca]]====\nAndrew and his father have a complicated relationship. Vincenzo took him and his sister out on fishing trips, took him on trips on the back of his motorcycle, and taught him how to play soccer and the names of the stars. However, Vincenzo also killed four people while operating in a manic state and never took responsibility for it as he got away with it because of his connections.\n\nAfter Catherine's party, just as Andrew was about to show Meredith his apartment, Carina returned to America with Vincenzo, who was here to propose research for an external womb to the hospital. While Carina didn't trust their father's mental state, Andrew signed on to work on the project after Vincenzo told him this would put him on the map. However, Vincenzo's manic symptoms started to show when the project started failing, leading him to offer the incomplete research to a hospital patient. Andrew had an emotional confrontation with Vincenzo, the project was shut down, and Vincenzo returned to Italy.\n\n===Friendships===\n====[[Jo Wilson]]====\nOne evening, Jo was drunk and Andrew took her home. Jo confessed that she couldn't marry Alex because she was already married. When Alex came home, he saw Andrew on top of Jo and thought Andrew was attempting to assault her. Andrew tried to defend himself, but Alex repeatedly punched Andrew. Shortly afterward, Alex was arrested for the assault while Andrew was treated at the hospital. In the aftermath of Alex's arrest, Andrew and Jo bonded because they weren't allowed to speak to others about the trial. When Jo learned that she had to testify, she worried that she would have to talk about her husband. Not wanting to put her through that trouble, Andrew told the DA he'd refuse to cooperate, forcing them to drop the charges against Alex.\n\n===Professional===\n====[[Alex Karev]]====\nHe got off to a bad start with Alex, who mistakenly believed Andrew hated kids because he didn't want to work in peds.<ref>[[I Choose You]], 12x03</ref> He was later attacked by Alex at Alex and Jo's apartment because Alex saw him on top of Jo when she was drunk.<ref>[[Family Affair]], 12x24</ref> While Alex awaited trial for assault, the two avoided each other. The night before Alex's trial, he decided to take a plea deal to get two years, but before he could do so, Andrew came in and told the DA he wanted to drop the charges. When the DA said it wasn't his case to drop, Andrew said he'd say that it was all a misunderstanding that got out of hand, tanking the DA's case.<ref>[[Jukebox Hero]], 13x11</ref> Alex later apologized to Andrew for what happened, which is what Andrew wanted in the first place.<ref>[[None of Your Business]], 13x12</ref> When they had to work together, Alex asked if they were cool and Andrew assured him that they were.<ref>[[Civil War]], 13x15</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAndrew was an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\nHe was chosen as the new [[Resident#Chief Resident|Chief Resident]] after there was a walkout of doctors in support of [[Meredith Grey]]. He decided to go to medical school after working as an EMT after high school. After a year as a surgical intern, he passed his intern exam and became a [[Resident|resident]]. Subsequently, he has been described by his superiors as one of the star residents of the hospital.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He played the guitar.\n*He said he had a lot of trouble getting to the second date because his first dates usually ended in sex and then women seemed to assume he had moved on.<ref>[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]], 12x04</ref>\n*Andrew didn't know baseball.\n*Andrew was Italian and spoke Italian, like [[Giacomo Gianniotti]] himself.<ref>[[Break Down the House]], 14x01</ref>\n*Andrew's given name is Andrea.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], 14x02</ref>\n*During his hospitalization for his assault, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]] said his mother knew her and that she was probably at work.
