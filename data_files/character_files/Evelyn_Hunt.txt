It's what I used to tell Owen's dad. They're gonna sail away from us, I said. It's inevitable. Our job is to build a boat strong enough that, when they decide to, they can get back to us safely.|'''Evelyn Hunt''' to '''[[Amelia Shepherd]]'''}}\n\n'''Evelyn Hunt''' is the mother of [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] and [[Megan Hunt]].\n\n==History==\n===Early Life===\nEvelyn was in the military and served in the Vietnam War. Afterwards, she settled down in Seattle with her husband and had two children: Owen and Megan. The family lived only five miles from Seattle Grace Hospital. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n===Owen's Return Home===\nShe is shown hugging Owen after finding out he was back from Iraq. He did not want to tell his mom he was back until Cristina convinced him to see her. ''(\"[[Here's to Future Days]]\")''\n\n===Owen and Cristina's Wedding===\nShe attended her son's wedding to [[Cristina Yang]]. ''(\"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\")''\n\n===Accident===\nAfter living as a widow for over thirty years, Evelyn met [[John Finch]] at a writers group. John was fascinated by her stories about her time in the service, as he had himself been in the navy. The two eventually fell in love, but Evelyn chose not to tell her son about John just yet.\n\nOne morning, however, Evelyn had been feeling dizzy and as she was taking a shower, she fell through the glass door. She was admitted to GSMH, John by her side, much to her son's surprise. Owen was concerned that John was only conning her, and seeing her son's harsh reaction, Evelyn broke up with John. However, she then began suffering from severe abdominal pain, startling both Owen and John, who refused to leave without knowing that she would be fine.\n\nEvelyn's pains turned out to stem from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and she was rushed into surgery. Had she not already been in the hospital, the rupture would've been fatal, but since she was, the surgery was successful and she was awake and stable afterwards. She then reunited with John, whom Owen had asked to stay, having seen that John was genuinely in love with his mother. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n===Mt. Baker Fire===\nWhen a fire broke out on Mt. Baker, John was called to the scene, where he was seriously injured. Evelyn came to the hospital to be with him. She sat by his bedside after surgery and was told he'd make a full recovery. She was shocked to see [[Nathan Riggs]] at the hospital, but greeted him warmly. She then told Meredith the history between Owen and Nathan. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\n===Owen and Amelia's Wedding===\nShe attended Owen and Amelia's wedding. At the wedding, she said Amelia looked stunning. ''(\"[[Family Affair]]\")''\n\n===Megan's Return===\nWhen Megan was found in Iraq and brought back to the United States, Evelyn came to see her in the hospital. She wasn't sure about Megan having the more radical surgery, but she was supportive of Megan's decision. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\n===Confronting Owen===\nMegan got Evelyn and Teddy together in order to talk to them about Owen and Amelia's marriage. They all agreed that it didn't seem like a stable marriage. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\n===Helping Amelia===\nWhen Amelia struggled with what to do with Betty, Owen mentioned that his mother ruled with an iron fist, so Amelia called her to get help. Evelyn assured her that she should drug test her and ground her. She said it sounded like Betty needed a mother, so she should be one. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\n===Owen and Teddy's Wedding===\nOn the day Owen and Teddy were supposed to get married, Evelyn came to their house to get the house ready for it. When Owen called and lied that he got called into a last-minute surgery, she helped take down the decorations and informed Teddy, whom Owen didn't call. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n===COVID-19 Pandemic===\nDuring the [[COVID-19 Pandemic]], Evelyn took care of her son's two children while he and Teddy worked at the hospital. During this time, she and Leo made up a game in which she wrapped him in pillows and he pretended he was sleeping on a cloud. ''(\"[[In My Life]]\")''\n\nWhen there was a leftover vaccine from personnel vaccinations at the hospital in January 2021, Owen called up his mother. After he administered the first dose, Evelyn worried she had stolen someone's vaccine but Owen assured her it would have ended up in the trash otherwise. Teddy arrived moments later to witness the event. Evelyn told her she could administer the second dose. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Teddy and Owen's Wedding===\nEvelyn came to her son's wedding to Teddy along with her daughter and grandson. The ceremony started, but before the priest could finish, he was hit by a couple on a tandem bicycle when they lost control during a bike race. Despite the interruption, Teddy and Owen married later that day at [[Emerald City Bar]] with their friends and family present. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====Late Husband====\nHer husband, Owen and Megan's father, died 32 years prior to her hospitalization. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n====[[John Finch]]====\nEvelyn met John at a writers group, having began to write stories about her time in military service. John was fascinated about her stories and the two began talking and bonding, eventually starting to meet outside the group as well. According to Evelyn, it took her weeks to realize that he was dating her, and she was astonished that a young man like John was interested in a widow like her. However, she had also fallen for him, and when he kissed her, she felt like they were the same age, all the years between them melting away. ''(\"[[With or Without You]]\")''\n\n===Familial===\n[[Owen Hunt]] is her son. She also has a daughter, [[Megan Hunt|Megan]], who went missing when a helicopter carrying her disappeared in the battlefield. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")'' She was believed to be lost or dead in the Iraqi desert for ten years before the Army informed Owen that Megan had been found. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")'' For those ten years, Megan was held prisoner by rebel forces, but treated well. Evelyn has three grandchildren: [[Farouk Shami Hunt]], [[Leo Hunt]], and [[Allison Hunt]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She has a cat.<ref>[[With or Without You]], 11x17</ref>\n*It is implied that Evelyn Hunt was a scrub nurse either prior to her military service or during as she responded to [[Meredith Grey|Dr. Grey]] regarding her daughter's surgery, \"Well, I admit I've been out of the O.R. for a while...\"<ref>[[Break Down the House]], 14x01</ref>\n*She lives only a few miles away from [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].<ref>[[Here's to Future Days]], 5x23</ref>\n*Father Patrick is her favorite priest.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], 18x01</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n523Mrs.Hunt.png|[[Here's to Future Days]]\n701Mrs.Hunt.png|[[With You I'm Born Again]]\n11x17EvelynHunt.png|[[With or Without You]]\n12x08EvelynHunt.png|[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Grey's Anatomy)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\n12x24EvelynHunt.png|[[Family Affair]]\n14x01EvelynHunt.png|[[Break Down the House]]\n14x02EvelynHunt.png|[[Get Off on the Pain]]\n15x04EvelynHunt.png|[[Momma Knows Best]]\n16x21EvelynHunt.png|[[Put on a Happy Face]]\n17x17EvelynHunt.png|[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\n18x01EvelynHunt.png|[[Here Comes the Sun]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n7x01-16.jpg\n7x01-24.jpg\n7x01-34.jpg\n11x17-2.jpg\n11x17-6.jpg\n12x24-30.jpg\n12x24-31.jpg\n12x24-32.jpg\n12x24-33.jpg\n18x01-4.jpg\n18x01-6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Evelyn Hunt Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Evelyn Hunt]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hunt, Evelyn}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
