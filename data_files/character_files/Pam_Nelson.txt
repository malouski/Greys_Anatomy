She had stolen her daughter's car because her daughter didn't allow her to drive because she was almost completely deaf. A tendon in her knee was ruptured and she had a hematoma in her temporal area.\n\nThey ran a CT and Mark looked at it and noted that she was deaf. She had otosclerosis and needed only a simple surgery to restore her hearing. She had no bleeding in her brain, so Derek cleared her.\n\nThey took her into surgery to repair her knee and then to remove the abnormal bone growth in her ear to restore her hearing.\n\nAfter Pam's surgery, she woke up and was able to hear normally. She and Kathy agreed that Kathy would move out.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe lives with her daughter, Kathy, who takes care of her. She allowed it because she wanted to take care of Kathy after she got divorced. After her surgery, they agreed that Kathy would move out.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nelson, Pam}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
