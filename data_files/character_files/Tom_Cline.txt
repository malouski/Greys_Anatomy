Her tricuspid valve had started to fail, so she came back to the hospital to have it replaced again. Burke was concerned about how quickly her valve had failed, but she was unconcerned. She was excited about having gotten married since her previous surgery and said she was excited about her life. They started looking into reasons why her valve might have failed so quickly. Naomi denied drug use, but because of her euphoria, the doctors believed she was lying, so they ran a tox screen.\n\nHer tox screen was negative, so they scheduled her for her valve replacement. Meredith then spoke to Sophie's husband and decided to run a second tox screen after he shared his concerns about her constant euphoria.\n\nHer second tox screen was also negative, but her serotonin level was extremely high. Burke put together that she had a carcinoid tumor in her lung, which had also caused the asthma she developed after her first surgery. The tumor was causing her euphoria and had also made her valve fail. They scheduled a tumor resection.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe met his wife, Naomi, in a grocery store. When she was still euphoric long after the wedding, he became concerned because no one could be that happy for so long.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cline, Tom}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
