He couldn't feel that his legs were trapped in the door. He asked for his wife, Sara, who worked at the hospital. The doctors knew that as soon as they started to move him, he'd bleed out and die, so they rushed to bring his wife to him so she could say goodbye.\n\nWhile waiting for Sara to arrive, Stan asked Ray to help him hold on until Sara arrived. They shared a memory of when Stan met Sara and started singing \"I Can See Clearly Now.\"\n\nWhen Sara arrived, they talked for a few minutes and said goodbye. Sara then had to be pulled away by a firefighter so that they could get into the rig to get Ray out. When they started to open the rig, Stan had them stop because he saw an oxygen regulator imbedded in Ray's back. He knew Ray would bleed out if they moved him. They tried to tell Stan he'd saved Ray's life, but he'd bled to death. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part 1]]\")''\n\nAfter he died, Ray asked Meredith if she could close Stan's eyes.
