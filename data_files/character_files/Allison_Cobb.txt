She was hopeful that the drug would reverse his condition entirely, as she'd read that there had been reversal when the drug was used in rats and monkeys.\n\nWhile waiting for his surgery, Daniel became confused and kept asking for his wife, [[Victoria]]. [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] asked Allison who Victoria was and she told her that Victoria was a woman who lived in the same nursing home as Daniel. They'd met the previous year there and despite both of them being married, they fell in love.\n\nBefore Daniel's surgery, Allison begged Alex just to give Daniel the drug because she needed her husband. Alex said he couldn't because even he didn't know ahead of time. Daniel was designated to receive the placebo, which was injected in his surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, he was awake and asked again for Victoria. His wife was upset, so Alex told her just to be patient, to be whatever he needed, even if that didn't mean being his wife. She then told Daniel she'd go get Victoria for him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Daniel Cobb]]. They met when they were at college together when he saw her in the student union and followed her to her French poetry class in a snowstorm.
