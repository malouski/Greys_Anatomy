Colin was rushed to the hospital, where they determined that the bullet had gone through his hand into his chest. His fingers were broken, but he had good blood flow to his hand, meaning it was salvageable. They took him into surgery, where they removed the bullet and repaired the damage to his chest while Jackson worked on his hand. They had to remove a portion of one of his lungs, but his father was told he'd compensate well after some rehab. Jackson was also able to save his hand and put in pins to repair the fractures. After his surgery, he was resting in his hospital room with his father when they heard [[Pete]] downstairs playing a song by himself to cheer Colin up.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis father stayed by his side the whole time he was in the hospital, aside from when he was in surgery.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 15 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He and his father play in a Scottish pipe band with [[Pete]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x13-3.jpg\n15x13-4.jpg\n15x13-5.jpg\n15x13-6.jpg\n15x13-19.jpg\n15x13-21.jpg\n15x13-23.jpg\n15x13-24.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, Colin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
