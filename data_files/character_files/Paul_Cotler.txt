The doctors planned a more radical approach to remove her malignant myxomas, but he was worried about it. After he was told it was likely her only chance as each surgery made her heart weaker, he asked [[Cristina Yang]] if she would let [[Teddy Altman]] do the surgery on her own husband. When she said she would, he agreed to the surgery.\n\nWhen he saw Cristina Yang come out to the waiting room during Linda's surgery, he asked about it. When Cristina apologized, he believed Linda had died, but Meredith assured him that she was still alive and they would come tell him when they were done operating. Linda survived her surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Linda Cotler]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cotler, Paul}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
