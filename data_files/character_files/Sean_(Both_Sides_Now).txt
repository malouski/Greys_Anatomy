The transplant went forward as planned and June's family was told it went well. Sean celebrated by taking a selfie including the doctors and the whole family.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhen June needed a liver transplant, Sean and the rest of the family came to the hospital to support her.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x05-29.jpg\n13x05-30.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Sean}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
