Due to lack of proper care and the fact that she had AIDS, she hadn't healed properly. While she was in the hospital, she began to cough up blood. They couldn't stop the bleeding, so they rushed her into surgery. She had a perforated abdomen and intestinal TB, which made it look like someone had poured glue into her abdomen. They were able to repair the perforation without having to remove much of the bowel and planned to start anti-TB meds afterward.\n\nApril was concerned because Asha was very scared and hadn't eaten anything since arriving at the hospital. She wanted to give Asha some food that would be familiar, so she made her a kind of corn porridge in the hopes that she might eat it.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was ten at the time of her hospitalization.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ID)]]"}}}]}}}}
