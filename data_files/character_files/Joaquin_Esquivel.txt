He said the paperwork hadn't been sent over from the court, so she couldn't be released yet. Meredith tried to persuade him by offering him medical care for him or his loved ones, but he said he liked being outside the cell more than being in it. When Meredith's paperwork came through, Joaquin came to get her and let her out. As she signed her paperwork on her way out, she asked Joaquin to help her with a favor. He later went back to the cell to tell Paula her bail had been paid and she was also being released.\n\n==Career==\nHe works as a guard at the jail where Meredith and [[Paula (Season 16)|Paula]] were housed.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Esquivel, Joaquin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
