He had moved back to Seattle only a week before in order to be his mother's caretaker, as they required the caretaker to be a full-time resident of the state of Washington.\n\nWhen his mother found out that he'd broken up with his boyfriend, Gavin, in order to move back, she dropped out of the trial and told him to go back to London to be with Gavin.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is dating a man named Gavin. They've been together for at least three years. Tarik dumped him to move back to Seattle when his mom was accepted in the trial, but Gavin had a hard time accepting that. He tried to move to Seattle to be with Tarik, but Tarik said he'd grow to resent him and he didn't want that. He moved back to London to be with Gavin at his mother's insistence.\n\n===Familial===\nHis mother stood by him when he came out as gay, even though it caused his father to leave her and find a new wife. Because of that, he moved to Seattle to be her caretaker without hesitation when she was accepted into Derek's trial. When she found out what he had done for her, she said it made her very proud to have raised such a good son, but told him to move back to London.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He ran a marathon.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amin, Tarik}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
