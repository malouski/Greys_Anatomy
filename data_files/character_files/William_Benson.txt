He looked at how many witnesses were on the list and said they needed to get started quickly. He listened as both sides questioned witnesses. When Meredith snapped and confronted [[Paul Castello]], who was set to vote on Meredith's license, William suggested they end the hearing while they looked into the conflict of interest and reschedule later. However, after Paul collapsed with a seizure and was taken away in an ambulance, Alex brought in a slew of patients whose lives were saved by Meredith Grey. William listened as they all sang Meredith's praises. Then Alex read a letter from Cristina about Meredith. He said he had others, but William stopped him and cleared the room so the panel could make their decision. The two remaining panel members voted for her to keep her license, rending Paul's vote irrelevant.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a judge.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x08-16.jpg\n16x08-17.jpg\n16x08-18.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Benson, William}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
