They lived into adulthood without being separated, but as adults, they looked into separation. They decided against it initially because Pete was scared of the risks, but then six months later, they reconsidered because Jake had fallen in love with [[Elena]] and wanted to be able to be with her without his brother coming along. They'd had a fight over Pete taking Elena's side in an argument and Pete accidentally touching Elena while she and Jake were having sex.\n\nThe doctors set up dummies that represented Jake and Pete and practice the surgery. [[Derek Shepherd]] thought the surgery was too risky, but he was convinced to go ahead. Despite a problem during surgery, each of them had two functioning legs and were successfully separated.\n\nAfterward, in recovery, Elena came to see Pete, but he was disinterested in her. He was put in a room with his brother and they started to make-up with each other, holding hands when their beds were pushed together.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe had feelings for his brother's girlfriend, [[Elena]]. She reciprocated the feelings, but also loved Jake.\n\n===Familial===\nHe was born conjoined to his brother, Jake. They had rules that governed their lives and helped keep the peace between them. Jake became upset when Pete didn't follow the rules and interfered while Jake was on a date with Elena. They ultimately decided to be separated so they could have some privacy.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He has a small bladder.\n*He and his brother were 35 when they were separated.\n*It took 22 surgeons to separate them.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weitzman, Peter}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
