They went out, but on the road, they were hit by a car driven by [[Brooke James]]. They were taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where Jack's injuries were assessed to be minor, while Dylan had mesenteric stranding, indicating injury to the mesentery. The doctors asked for the names of their parents so they could be contacted, but Dylan, fearing that he'd be in trouble, told Jack not to tell them. He was taken in for laparoscopic surgery, but they ultimately had to open him up to repair the damage. While he was in surgery, Jack gave [[Miranda Bailey]] Dylan's cell phone, which she used to call their parents. After his surgery, they came to his bedside.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nDylan lives with his parents and his little brother, Jack. The two brothers seem to get along well. When Dylan asked Jack not to give the doctors their parents' names, he agreed.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*While in the ER, he lied and said he was 18.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x09-1.jpg\n11x09-3.jpg\n11x09-7.jpg\n11x09-8.jpg\n11x09-9.jpg\n11x09-10.jpg\n11x09-12.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
