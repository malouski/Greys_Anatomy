He'd had chemo to try to shrink the tumor, but it didn't work and [[Callie Torres]] and [[Arizona Robbins]] recommended amputation. However, because Jake was a ballet dancer, he didn't want to let them take his leg. They did research and [[Alex Karev]] found a case in which they removed the bone that was affected, dosed it with radiation, and then re-implanted it. His parents were worried because it was risky, but they agreed to let him have the surgery. The surgery went well and Jake's labs were good afterward.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Fred Fisher]].\n\n===Familial===\nHer son, Jake, is a ballet dancer, a talent that Vickie and her husband fully support. Fred even bragged to the doctors about Jake's dancing.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fisher, Vickie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
