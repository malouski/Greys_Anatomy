Initially, the surgeons looked down on her for allowing it to get this bad. This attitude came to light when Alex took her for a [[Computed Tomography|CT]] scan and left the microphone on, allowing Annie to hear him bad mouthing her to the technician. It was only when George asked her why she let it get that bad that she revealed that every time someone she loved went into hospital, they did not come out alive.\n\nKnowing that she would die unless the tumor was removed, she consented. Once in the OR, it was planned that Burke would work to remove the section of tumor attached to the front of her body and once he had finished, she would be rolled onto her back and Derek would remove what was attached to her spine. Cristina and George were assigned the exhausting task of holding up the tumor during surgery. George angered Burke when an itch caused him to lose his grip. Miranda Bailey commented that some of the blood vessels in the tumor were as thick as human thumbs.\n\nAfter Burke was called away to an emergency, Derek took over. Unfortunately, a vessel burst and Annie started to bleed heavily. Not having enough blood to transfuse after having used it all, including the extra supply they had stocked, Alex, who had been banned from the surgery for his earlier behavior, ran to the blood bank to get more. Sadly, by the time he arrived, Annie had died on the table.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother came to the hospital with her and pushed her to have the surgery.\n\nShe hated hospitals because every time she went to one someone died, including her father, all four grandparents, and her little sister, plus her best friend's mom.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 43 at the time of her death.\n*She'd been housebound for a year before her hospitalization.\n*She was pronounced dead at 11:42.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n106-1.jpg\n106-2.jpg\n106-3.jpg\n106-5.jpg\n106-6.jpg\n106-9.jpg\n106-14.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Connors, Annie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
