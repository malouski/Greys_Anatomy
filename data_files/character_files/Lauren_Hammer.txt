She'd looked up her symptoms on the internet and was convinced that she had stomach cancer. Alex took a stool sample. She admitted that she'd ordered antibiotics to treat a staph infection she'd diagnosed in herself. The antibiotics killed off all the healthy bacteria, so they needed to introduced new healthy bacteria. This required a fecal transplant from someone she shared everyday germs with. Her husband refused to donate until she would admit that it was a pimple, not a staph infection. She was only able to say that she believed that he believed it was just a pimple. She said that she's still convinced it's stomach cancer. Every minor thing, she thinks is a big thing. He finally agreed to provide the sample and she received a transplant with him waiting in the lobby.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Seth Hammer]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hammer, Lauren}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
