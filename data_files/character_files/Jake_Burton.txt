Scans revealed that he had a brain tumor, because the growths had turned inward.\n\nWhile Derek planned the tumor resection, Mark proposed a plan to remove the growths from the outside of Jake's skull, giving him a more normal appearance. Derek was against the idea, but Jake wanted the surgery. After convincing his parents, they signed the consent so he could have the surgery. They planned to do both procedures under the same round of anesthesia to make things easier on Jake's body.\n\nJake died during the tumor resection, but Alex and Cristina had the idea that Mark could still fix his face for his parents. After he was done, Jake's parents came in to see his body and cried.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nJake's parents were scared because of his condition. When [[Mark Sloan]] proposed a way to give him a more normal appearance, they were reluctant to agree to the surgery because they were worried about losing him. When he died, they were devastated.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 15 at the time of his death.\n*He said he always noticed people's eyes because it was the only place on his face where tumors weren't growing.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x18-3.JPG\n2x18-5.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burton, Jake}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
