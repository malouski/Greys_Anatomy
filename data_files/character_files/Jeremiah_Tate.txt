She knew very little about cystic fibrosis and how to treat it, but she learned with his help. They grew very close in the process.\n\n===Hospitalization and Death===\nJeremiah came into the hospital because he'd been in a lot of pain and had had a few seizures. He believed it was his pancreatitis flaring up again. Scans revealed that he needed an exploratory laparotomy, but his lungs made Bailey hesitant to cut. She consulted with Addison, who had previous 2-year experience working with kids with CF,\u00a0who said she might have a way to help. They went to Jeremiah and presented their plan to him. He agreed to the surgery and wanted to call his parents, whom he always refused to call until he was better again. Bailey talked him out of it, saying he'd be fine.\n\nThey took him into surgery, but he was already not doing well. He had no urine output. He started coding and Bailey started CPR, despite his DNR. Meredith convinced Bailey to let her take over when she was getting tired while Addison tried to convince Bailey that Jeremiah wasn't coming back. He was pronounced dead in the OR. After his death, Bailey called his parents.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nJeremiah didn't like to worry his parents, so he only called them after he was out of the hospital.\n\n===Professional===\nHe had a great relationship with Miranda Bailey. He was one of her first patients and held a special place in her heart.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 26 at the time of his death.\n*He ran triathlons to raise money for cystic fibrosis research.\n*He was pronounced dead at 19:26.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tate, Jeremiah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Genetics)]]"}}}]}}}}
