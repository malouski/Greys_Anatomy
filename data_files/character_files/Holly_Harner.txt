She was found by one of Corey's neighbors, who called an ambulance.\n\nAt the hospital, they told her her arm was broken in two places and she had free fluid in her abdomen, which was from a splenic laceration. She told them that she had an inoperable heart tumor that she was aware of. In order to avoid surgery, they did a splenic embolization, which was successful.\n\nAfter seeing Holly's scan, Maggie believed she could resect the tumor. Holly didn't want her to try, but Maggie convinced her. Maggie operated and was able to remove a portion of the tumor, which would relieve some of her symptoms and give her more time, but she couldn't remove it all. Holly reassured them that she was okay, that she'd accepted it, just like she told them she'd end up doing if they tried to operate.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nAfter her diagnosis, she started having a string of one-night stands as it was the only thing she could think of that would make her feel better. The latest of those was with [[Corey]], whom she said was boring, but well endowed. When he showed up at the hospital, Holly asked the doctors to tell him she was dead so he'd leave.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She says she has weird-looking toes.\n*She said Corey was the third-best sex of her life.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harner, Holly}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
