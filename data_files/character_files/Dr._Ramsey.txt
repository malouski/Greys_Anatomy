She forgot about this, saying she would be happy if he could be in the OR with her. She quickly apologized when she remembered he couldn't operate and invited him to observe instead.\n\nDuring the surgery, her patient had a complication. She told her colleagues to get the patient's head up. However, Derek, who was sitting in the gallery watching the surgery, stormed in and told her that they should get the patient's head down.\n\nAfter surgery, Derek had a conversation with Mark. He told him that he had Ramsey perform his technique, but she was unable to do so successfully, meaning the patient died.\u00a0''(\"[[Remember the Time]]\")''\n\n===Chiari Decompression===\n\nDerek\u00a0mentioned her when he promised Shane he'd put in a good word for him if Shane beat him in their ping pong game, so that Ramsey would allow him to scrub in on her chiari malformation decompression.\u00a0''(\"[[The End is the Beginning is the End]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nShe is an [[Attending|attending]] neurosurgeon at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ramsey, Dr.}}\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
