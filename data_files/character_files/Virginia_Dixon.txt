Richard wanted to have Bailey woo her so she'd accept the job as head of cardiothoracic surgery. At the end of the day, she said she knew she'd been manipulated into giving Clay his donor heart back and said she didn't really like Seattle Grace because of that. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\n===Return to Seattle Grace===\nShe returned to Seattle Grace and Cristina was assigned to woo her as Richard wanted her to be the new head of cardiothoracic surgery. She worked on the case of [[Holly Anderson]]. At the end of the day, she told Richard to have the board make her a better offer. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n===Stacy Pollock and Departure===\n[[File:5x14-4.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cristina and Bailey hug Virginia.]]\nDixon later returned again to work on [[Stacy Pollock]]. After Stacy's surgery, Dixon was unsettled when Bailey proposed using a backpack without consulting her first. When Stacy's parents hugged her enthusiastically, she abruptly left the room. Bailey and Cristina found her in a lounge, trying to soothe herself by tightening her lab coat around her body. Bailey and Cristina helped her by applying pressure to her body in a hugging motion, which allowed her to calm down. ''(\"[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nDr. Dixon is a [[Cardiothoracic Surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]], and the [[Richard Webber|Chief]] is trying to get her on staff as his new [[Attending#Department Head|head]] of cardiothoracic surgery following the departure of [[Erica Hahn|Dr. Erica Hahn]].\n\nShe is an extremely skilled surgeon, Karev remarking that she is the fastest that he has seen doing surgical procedures.\n\nIn her second visit to Seattle Grace, Dr. Webber approaches her about a job, and she only tells him \"Have your board make me a better offer.\"\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She stuttered as a child.\n*The character of Dr. Dixon has been criticized for not being truly representative of Asperger's syndrome as many of her traits appear to be too similar to autism, which even though both are part of the autism spectrum, were thought to be different and distinguishable. Since airing, however, it has been deemed that there is no significant difference between Asperger's and autism, and Asperger's as a diagnosis has been removed from the DSM, instead being covered under the diagnosis of \"Autism Spectrum Disorder\".\n*A deleted scene showing an exchange between Richard and Dixon outside the hospital reveals\u00a0that after her third visit, she ultimately refused Richard's offer, but accepted 'privileges' at Seattle Grace. She stated also that Bailey and Yang\u00a0were\u00a0very helpful to\u00a0her earlier that day (referring to\u00a0the\u00a0'hugging'\u00a0that had occurred).\n*She makes reference to cows being compressed before they're slaughtered, which Temple Grandin used to develop a hugging machine for humans used by many autistic people.<ref>[[Beat Your Heart Out]], 5x14</ref>\n*She finds the color of a heart comforting.<ref>[[These Ties That Bind]], 5x08</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n508VirginiaDixon.png|[[These Ties That Bind]]\n510VirginiaDixon.png|[[All By Myself]]\n514VirginiaDixon.png|[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n5x10-3.jpg\n5x10-4.jpg\n5x10-5.jpg\n5x10-13.jpg\n5x10-14.jpg\n5x14-2.jpg\n5x14-4.jpg\n5x14-6.jpg\n5x14-24.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Virginia Dixon Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Virginia Dixon]]\n[[fr:Virginia Dixon]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dixon, Virginia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
