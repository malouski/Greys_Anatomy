They were planned to ski out of a helicopter. Phil and Nick jumped, but an avalanche started before Tommy could jump. Nick and Phil were brought into the ER, where Phil had abdominal bruising, frostbite, and a scalp laceration. They ran a CT which showed no internal bleeding. They also decided that the scalp laceration was small enough that numbing it would hurt more than the staples, so they placed them without numbing the area.\n\nDuring his recovery, [[Callie Torres]] revealed to Nick and Phil that Tommy didn't enjoy their trips, which led to all of them admitting that they don't need them to keep their blood pumping anymore. So they agreed to go wine tasting in Napa instead of going to run with the bulls in Pamplona.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\n[[Nick Kelsey]], Phil, and [[Tommy]] are best friends. They went on several trips to keep their blood pumping, each not realizing that the others didn't need the trips.\n\n==Career==\nHe's an accountant. He was starting his own business.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*They'd previously climbed Kilimanjaro.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
