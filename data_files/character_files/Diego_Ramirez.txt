His parents tried to get him surgery in his home country of Venezuela, but they wouldn't find a doctor there willing to operate. Through Angels of Humanity, he was brought to the US to have surgery. They made a plan to remove most of the tumor, which would require additional operations when it grew back. However, during his surgery, Jackson changed the surgical plan and they ended up removing Diego's entire tumor, which involved placing a bone graft. The surgery went well.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis parents tried to get him surgery in Caracas, but no doctor there would touch his tumor.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ramirez, Diego}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
