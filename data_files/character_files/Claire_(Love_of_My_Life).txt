Claire was glad to hear that Teddy was not a lesbian. Before Teddy moved in, Allison had Claire promise she wouldn't like Teddy better than her since Teddy, like Claire, was also a surgeon at [[Columbia University Medical Center]]. Some time after Teddy moved in, Claire began suspecting that there was something going on between Teddy and Allison. She never told either of them of her suspicions.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Claire and Teddy saw on the news that the World Trade Center had been struck by planes hijacked by terrorists. Allison was killed as she was working in the South Tower at the time. Claire broke down in Teddy's arms. She tried to process her grief by trying to get an idea of Allison's final minutes had been like, if she had been in pain. She requested Allison's phone logs, which revealed that at 8:57 AM, Allison had tried to call Teddy and no one else, which proved to Claire that she and Teddy had been having an affair.\n\n===Moving===\nShortly after, Claire quit her job and left New York City as she felt too much grief there. She met her future wife Clara and they settled down in Clara's hometown in North Carolina, where they started a small practice together.\n\n===Conference===\nNearly 20 years after Allison's death, Claire ended up at the Surgical Innovation Conference and found Teddy there. They talked about Allison and Claire admitted that she knew that she and Teddy had been together behind her back. She initially seemed upset about it, but later told Teddy she'd forgiven her. Teddy then explained that Allison was in love with both of them at the same time, which she didn't believe was possible at the time but later came to understand.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====Clara====\nShe is married to a woman named Clara, who is also a doctor. They run a small practice together in Clara's hometown in North Carolina.\n\n====[[Allison Robin Brown]]====\nShe was dating Allison until her death on 9/11. Despite this, Allison was cheating on her with Teddy, their friend and roommate. Claire suspected this for months, but it was confirmed when she retrieved Allison's phone logs after her death and learned the last person she tried to call was Teddy.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a [[Vascular Surgery|vascular surgeon]]. She worked at [[Columbia University Medical Center]] with Teddy Altman but quit her job and left the city after 9/11 because there was too much grief there. Currently, she and her wife Clara run a small practice together in North Carolina.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x19-16.jpg\n16x19-17.jpg\n16x19-18.jpg\n16x19-40.jpg\n16x19-41.jpg\n16x19-42.jpg\n16x19-43.jpg\n16x19-49.jpg\n16x19-50.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Claire}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
