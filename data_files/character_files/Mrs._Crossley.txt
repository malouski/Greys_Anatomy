It was a simple procedure and she was scheduled to be able to go home that evening. Her surgery went well, but after she was discharged, her husband brought her back in, dangling her by her ankles, because every time he put her down, her heart stopped. A lead in her pacemaker had become disconnected when she coughed and she had to be taken into the OR to have it reconnected. In a race to be chosen to scrub in over [[Stephanie Edwards]], [[Leah Murphy]] accidentally connected Mrs. Crossley's oxygen to her IV, a potentially fatal mistake. However, the mistake was quickly rectified and Mrs. Crossley was fine.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nMrs. Crossley is married to [[Mr. Crossley]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crossley, Mrs.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
