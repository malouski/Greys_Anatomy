He pursued her until she said yes to a date with him. On the date, he started kissing her. She tried to stop him, but he wouldn't take no for an answer and raped her. While she was pregnant, she was terrified that she'd give birth to a boy that had her rapist's face. She'd heard about women seeing their babies for the first time and their hearts cracking open. Nine months later, she gave birth to [[Jo Wilson]] at Emerson Hospital. She left as soon as possible and her heart cracked open just like she'd heard it would, but as much as she tried, it couldn't be just the two of them. Five days after giving birth, she left Jo at a fire station.\n\nLater, she found her way to therapy and worked through her PTSD and triggers. At graduate school, she met [[Daniel Rudin]], whom she later married. They also had two children.\n\nJo wanted answers and traveled to her home to find them. She asked Vicki to have one conversation with her at a nearby diner. During their conversation, Vicki told Jo the story of how she came to be, but Jo was angry with her for not making sure she ended up with a family who wanted a baby. Vicki replies that she did the best she could and that even though she feels sorry for what happened to Jo, she remains confident that she couldn't have been a good mother to her at the time.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Daniel Rudin]]. They met in graduate school.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband have two children: Alexandra, who is a senior in high school and Josh, who is a sophomore.\n\nHer mother's parents died young, one of heart disease and the other of cancer.\n\n==Career==\nShe works for the mayor's office, trying to create jobs in underserved communities.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her family has a dog named Chip.\n*She's full Irish on her father's side and Russian Jewish and Italian on her mother's.\n*She was the spelling bee champ four years in a row.\n*She loves the smell of rosemary.\n*She's terrible at math.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x19-18.jpg\n15x19-19.jpg\n15x19-20.jpg\n15x19-21.jpg\n15x19-22.jpg\n15x19-23.jpg\n15x19-24.jpg\n15x19-25.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rudin, Vicki Ann}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
