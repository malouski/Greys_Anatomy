[[Mark Sloan]] was able to get good margins, but Nick was left with only a flap of skin covering his carotid artery. Because of this, the concern was that it would rupture. Mark said that if that happened, whoever was in the room needed to stop the bleeding and page him immediately.\n\nLexie examined him several times that day. When Lexie came in upset, he asked her about it. He joked with her and started to laugh. While he was laughing, his artery burst, spraying blood all over Lexie. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part 1]]\")''\n\nLexie quickly jumped in to stop the bleeding. He was shocked that it actually happened. After she stopped the bleeding, Lexie had Nick use his phone to call the nurses' station so she could page Mark and call a code.\n\nThey tried to hang blood to transfuse, but they couldn't get a good vein because he'd lost so much blood and his veins were flaccid. They were able to start transfusing and then they prepared to move him to the OR. He had a stroke and then they rushed him to the OR. Because the OR wasn't available, they moved him to a sterile procedure room. In the procedure room, Mark attempted to stop the bleeding and repair his carotid, but he was unsuccessful and Nick was pronounced dead.

He described her as a nice girl disguised as a vapid narcissist, though it turned out she was really just a vapid narcissist.
