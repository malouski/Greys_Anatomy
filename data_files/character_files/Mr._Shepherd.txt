They saw each other and they immediately knew they wanted to be together.\n\n===Death===\nHe was apparently a loving husband and father. He owned a shop and was killed by two men who attempted to steal his money and his watch. He refused because his watch was a gift from his wife and one of the men killed him by shooting him. Two of his children, Amelia, 5, and her older brother Derek were there, and it was Derek who was first to see his dad dead. ''(\"[[Who We Are]]\")''\n\n===After His Death===\nYears later, his death is still difficult for his family. His wife always sleeps on her side of the bed, even though the mattress is extremely uneven. Derek hates murderers and had difficulty dealing when one was a patient, as he was still very angry about his dad's death. Amelia has problems with drugs which are related to her father's death. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\")''\n\nAfter his death, Amelia was afraid of all loud noises. To get over this fear, she bought firecrackers and set them off until she wasn't afraid anymore. ''(\"[[You Break My Heart]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He loved to give pennies to his daughter Amelia when she was a child.<ref>[[Who We Are]], 5x08 (PP)</ref>\n*He is the father of 5 doctors, including one psychiatrist, one OB/GYN, and two neurosurgeons.\n*He has at least 19 grandchildren: 11 granddaughters (including [[Zola Grey Shepherd|Zola]] and [[Ellis Shepherd|Ellis]]) and 8 grandsons (including [[Christopher Shepherd|Christopher]], who is deceased, [[Derek Bailey Shepherd|Bailey]], and [[Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln]]).\n*His only son, Derek, says that he misses his father all the time.\n*The flashbacks he appeared in were reused in [[Could We Start Again, Please?]].\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Mr Sheperd (p\u00e8re)]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shepherd, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:PP Characters]]\n[[Category:PP S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
