When Meredith stopped working to talk to [[Suzie Wilson]], Robin told her to get back to work before she told the court Meredith was in contempt. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\n===Cancer Diagnosis===\nMeredith noticed that Robin had a lump in her neck and looked at it closer. She then did an ultrasound of Robin's neck, which was concerning, so she called Jackson to do a biopsy. The biopsy revealed papillary thyroid cancer. Robin was upset because without Meredith, she'd have had to wait two more months and only been able to see the ENT if she could afford the time off work. She struggled to afford her asthma inhalers, so she felt that being diagnosed with cancer was forcing her to choose between bankruptcy or death. ''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Hearing===\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing to determine if she would lose her medical license, Robin was among those who testified on her behalf. Robin told the board how Meredith diagnosed her cancer and arranged for her to have pro bono treatment, though Meredith hadn't taken credit for it. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nShe works for the department of corrections. Part of her job is overseeing people who have been assigned to clean up litter as their community service.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She has asthma and her inhalers cost $500 with her insurance only covering one per month.<ref>[[Back in the Saddle]], 16x02</ref>\n*She can be heard yelling at Meredith to get back to work in [[Reunited]]. It appears that the audio from a previous episode was used since the actress was not credited.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n16x01Robin.png|[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\n16x02Robin.png|[[Back in the Saddle]]\n16x08Robin.png|[[My Shot]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x02-42.jpg\n16x02-43.jpg\n16x02-44.jpg\n16x08-21.jpg\n16x08-29.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Robin Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Robin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
