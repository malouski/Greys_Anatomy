He was surprised to see [[Noah Young]] at the meeting, as Noah had always refused to attend before. Noah then introduced him to [[Owen Hunt]], who was gathering information to do a study to prove the connection between the burn pits and their illnesses. While he explained, Roy started coughing up blood and collapsed, so they called an ambulance to take him to the hospital.\n\nIn the ER, they did chest films. He already knew he had pulmonary fibrosis, but learned he had early stage lung cancer. Because of his fibrosis, he couldn't afford to lose any lung tissue, meaning they couldn't remove the lobe as they normally would to treat the cancer. Roy was desperate to get enough time to lobby congress, so he asked them to do a segmentectomy, to remove just the cancerous portion, despite its additional risks. Before he was anesthetized, Roy admitted that he'd authorized the burning of some trash, because he'd heard it was something others were doing to deal with the trash that was piling up. He felt responsible and wanted to make it right. His surgery was successful, but afterward, he coded and was unable to be resuscitated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was divorced.\n\n===Familial===\nHis daughter is married with two kids and lives on the east coast. He never saw her because he says she took her mother's side in the divorce.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe describes [[Noah Young]], whom he met as a new recruit, as the closest thing he has to a son.\n\n==Career==\nHe was a colonel in the US Military.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Roy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
