They did a neuro exam and got a CT. The CT showed a small amount of blood in his ventricle, but Derek believed it would resolve itself, so he kept him for observation.\n\nDuring a later neuro check, he was altered, so Meredith believed he had acute hydrocephalus from a clot. They drilled a burr hole in his hospital room to relieve the pressure. Once they drained the blood, he stabilized and woke up. Rick insisted on staying in the room while they drilled the burr hole, but after it was done, he vomited on [[Debbie|Nurse Debbie]].\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Michael Beglight]]. They have one son together.\n\n===Familial===\nHe is very protective of his son, [[Shawn Beglight|Shawn]].
