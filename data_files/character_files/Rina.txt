She'd had no prenatal care, so Joe and Walter brought her to [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]], who did an ultrasound, which revealed that she was pregnant with twins, which she didn't know. During the exam, she complained of heartburn, so Addison gave her an antacid.\n\nWalter took her to the bus station to go home, but she started having severe chest pain, so he brought her back to the bar where she collapsed and had to be taken to the ER. ''(\"[[Testing 1-2-3]]\")''\n\nIn the ER, [[Preston Burke]] took over her care and said she'd need surgery for an aortic dissection, which meant the babies would probably be born that day. They took her into the OR, where the babies were quickly delivered and Burke repaired her heart. After her surgery, she was stable and awake. Walter and Joe sat by her bedside as they held their newborn twins.
