She was in the hospital to have her tumor removed. However, when she learned that April would be doing her surgery instead of Meredith, she tried to refuse as she trusted Meredith. However, her surgery was fairly emergent, so she was told she really couldn't postpone it. During her surgery, she had a heart attack and when she woke up afterward, she was disappointed to learn that they hadn't removed the cancer. She blamed April for that. Later, she had trouble breathing due to gastric acid in her lungs caused by the staples April had put in to close her not holding. April rushed her back into surgery and repaired the damage. She was also able to remove Lynne's tumor. When Lynne woke up after surgery, she was delighted that the cancer was gone.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nShe had a good relationship with [[Meredith Grey]]. Meredith diagnosed her cancer, held her hand, and was supposed to operate on it. She tried to postpone her surgery when she learned that Meredith wasn't available.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She's been going to the same hairstylist for 23 years.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gagliano, Lynne}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
