His mother had taken him to his regular doctor, whom she said was a bad doctor who texted while she was talking to him, who said it was just growing pains. But she believed it was more, because Andy was falling down on the soccer field. So she took him to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]], where [[Arizona Robbins]] examined him. After talking through it with [[Miranda Bailey]], Arizona said that he had a mild case of scoliosis and his growth was likely aggravating his spine. She said they'd wait to see if it resolved and if it didn't, he'd come back in for more tests. In the meantime, she gave him a prescription for muscle relaxants.\n\nHe later came back to the hospital with serious pain in his inguinal area, legs, and back. He'd been vomiting all night. Arizona wanted to run a 3D MRI, but his mother's insurance wouldn't pay for it, so [[Richard Webber|Webber]] wouldn't let her run it, so she was forced to discharge him and refer him back to his primary care physician. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\nAndy had an infection, which they treated, and then continued to look for other choices. When Webber continued to refuse the 3D MRI, Arizona sent Andy over to [[Callie Torres|Callie]] at [[Mercy West Medical Center]] to get the scan. She did the scan, but it didn't show anything. Arizona and Callie continued to talk about possible causes for his pain. Arizona ultimately figured out that he had a tethered spinal cord. She went to Derek in order to get the scan she needed to confirm her theory. They told Andy and his mother what was wrong and then took him into surgery to clip the cord, freeing him of pain. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis mother is very protective of him. When he was hospitalized, she stayed by his side and when she believed the doctors treating him were distracted, she threatened to take him to another hospital. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\nHe told the doctors that before the back pain, his mom was like a normal mom. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 15 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x01AndyMichaelson.png|[[Good Mourning]]\n6x02AndyMichaelson.png|[[Goodbye]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Andy Michaelson Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Michaelson, Andy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
