She'd taken extra ibuprofen and gone to sleep, but the next morning, it was bruised and swollen, so she came into the clinic. She was supposed to meet her trainer at noon, so she asked if she could get a shot of cortisone and leave, but [[Miranda Bailey]] wanted to get an x-ray and said she couldn't treat her until she knew what was wrong.\n\nThe x-ray showed that her ankle was crushed. She was osteoporotic, which is why it was crushed. They ran labs to figure out why she had osteoporosis so young. She was missing vital nutrients and they asked if she'd been dieting. She said she'd just lost 40 pounds because Will said that if she got back down to a size four and he quit smoking, they'd move in together. They said she needed to make lifestyle changes in order to prevent this from happening again.\n\nWhen they were explaining her surgery to her, they said that healing would take longer if she didn't start eating more. However, she started vomiting up blood from a bleeding ulcer. They rushed her into surgery, but they were unable to save her life because of the overtraining.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was dating [[Will (The Heart of the Matter)|Will]]. They agreed to move in together if she lost 40 pounds and he quit smoking.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 28 at the time of her death.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sales, Ruthie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
