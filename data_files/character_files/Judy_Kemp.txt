They saw that her spleen was enlarged. They didn't know why, so they planned to remove it to determine why it was enlarged in the first place. Judy was taken into surgery. During her surgery, the hospital technology started to malfunction. After the power went out for a moment, [[Meredith Grey]] decided to convert to an open surgery. She called for blood, which [[Levi Schmitt]] was unable to get due to the hack. Desperate, Meredith asked the OR staff if anyone had the right blood type. Levi was the only one to volunteer, so he was hooked to Judy to give a direct transfusion. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nJudy's surgery continued, with Levi's blood transfusing into her. He became faint from blood loss and collapsed to the floor, so [[Paul Stadler]] stepped in to help operate on her. They had to remove part of her pancreas in addition to her spleen, but they were able to finish her surgery. Afterward, she asked to see Levi and she thanked him for saving her life and encouraged him to stand up straight and be proud of what he did. ''(\"[[1-800-799-7233]]\")''\n\nShe later returned to the hospital again, in the same pain as before, and it was discovered that she had several tiny spleens growing inside her. The remnant cells of her spleen had migrated and started growing again, making working spleens around her abdomen. She was taken into surgery to have them removed.
