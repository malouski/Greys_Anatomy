She had injuries to her head, wrist, and knee. After a CT and x-rays, her wrist was casted and she was told she'd need surgery because an artery under her skull had ruptured, so she was taken into the OR to repair that and the damage to her knee. They were concerned about her fainting spells, which Todd had told them several times, but she admitted that she'd been faking them to get out of answering his questions because she was uncomfortable with the attention he was giving her. She didn't know how close she was to the stairs when she fainted in the park.\n\nAfter Hillary's surgery, Todd was relieved to see that she was okay and said that he'd never leave her and she'd be okay. [[Callie Torres|Callie]] gestured from behind Todd, encouraging Hillary to break up with him. When she didn't do this and instead faked a fainting spell to get out of it, Callie took the reigns, explaining the situation to Todd as she led him out the door. Once he was gone, Hillary thanked Callie.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nTodd is a very romantic guy. He was dating [[Hillary List]], but wasn't aware that she was not comfortable with the amount of attention he was giving her. After her surgery, [[Callie Torres]] broke up with him for her and led him out the door.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He liked to pet Hillary.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
