He came into the hospital to have awake brain surgery to remove the tumor.\n\nWhile they were operating, the doctors made conversation with him to check his awareness and gauge when they got too close to the language center of the brain. As he was a champion speller getting ready for the national spelling bee, they tested him by having him spell several medical words. At one point, his speech started to slur, but he started speaking normally after they backed out of that area. They were then able to remove the whole tumor.\n\nAfter surgery, he was stable and awake, but he had no memory of the surgery whatsoever.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was in 7th grade at the time of his tumor resection.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Willis, Andrew}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
