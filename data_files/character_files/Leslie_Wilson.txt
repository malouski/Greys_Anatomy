Her heart rate spiked during surgery, but there was no bleeding. When [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] felt movement, Meredith noticed that the patient had woken up. As [[Ben Warren]] gave her more anesthesia to knock her back out, Meredith reassured her that despite her fear, she'd be okay.\n\nAfter surgery, believing she probably wouldn't remember having woken up, the doctors told her that her surgery had been successful and they removed the whole tumor. However, she told them that she remembered waking up and it terrified her.\n\nLater, when Bailey went to examine her incision site, Leslie refused to allow Bailey to touch her because Bailey had panicked in surgery. When Leslie started to bleed from her incision, she allowed Meredith to re-dress the wound.\n\nBen figured out that she metabolized anesthesia more quickly than most people, which is why she woke up. Since he knew it, he would be able to adjust her anesthesia for future surgeries. Leslie needed another surgery because her incision wouldn't stop bleeding, but she still refused to let Bailey operate. Her lawyer said he could arrange to have her transferred to another hospital, but she agreed to have the surgery if [[Meredith Grey]] would operate. Her second surgery was successful.\n\nAfter her surgery, [[Derek Shepherd]] came to her room and apologized to her for what had happened.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Brian Wilson]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wilson, Leslie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
