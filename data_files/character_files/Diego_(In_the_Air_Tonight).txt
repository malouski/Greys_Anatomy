He didn't like being on the plane and cried, upsetting nearby [[Lance]]. Meredith stepped in and asked Lance to stop being a jerk about it and then offered to switch seats with Diego's father, [[Bryan]], so the family could sit together as they hadn't been able to get seats together due to their last-minute booking.\n\nAfter they were in the air, the plane hit severe turbulence, which resulted in luggage falling on Diego's head and cutting him on the forehead. After the turbulence settled, the three doctors on board went around checking on people who had been injured. [[Harrison Peters]], a dentist, bandaged Diego's head, but Meredith later told him he might need a couple stitches.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe and his family were on their first trip together.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x20-7.jpg\n13x20-8.jpg\n13x20-9.jpg\n13x20-10.jpg\n13x20-11.jpg\n13x20-12.jpg\n13x20-13.jpg\n13x20-14.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Diego}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
