While his mother was being examined before her surgery, Meredith noticed a bump on Kyle's neck. He'd had it for a while and they had meant to get it checked out but hadn't had the time due to his mother's condition. Meredith had April Kepner examine him and after seeing his scans, Arizona Robbins diagnosed a cystic hygroma, which needed to be removed immediately because it was starting to close off his airway. [[Robert Stark]] also saw his scans and wanted to call child protective services on the parents for letting it go for so long. However, April convinced him not to call by saying that they'd have the parents bring Kyle in every time his mother had a follow-up for the trial and she'd exam him personally to make sure his health was being attended.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nKyle's mother has Alzheimer's disease. He did a large part of taking care of her, feeding her lunch and singing Johnny Cash to her to calm her down.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was ten at the time of his surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baker, Kyle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
