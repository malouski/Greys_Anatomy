Kim was experiencing severe stomach pain. Her friends believed she was just drunk or that she had been drugged. However, after they relayed the events of their day, [[April Kepner]] determined that one of the drinks she'd consumed, a smoking nipple, which contained liquid nitrogen, had caused an abdominal rupture. Kim was taken into surgery, where April performed a roux-en-y anastomosis to remove her stomach and attach her intestine directly to her esophagus.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nShe is friends with [[Kim Welles]] and [[Brenda]]. When Kim had abdominal pain after a night of drinking, the three of them went together to the ER.
