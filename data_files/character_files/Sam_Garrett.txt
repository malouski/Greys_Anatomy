Then he proposed that they go up in his plane, which she agreed to. On the plane, they had sandwiches.\n\n===Plane Crash===\nWhile on a date with Kate, Sam had a heart attack while flying his plane. She took over the controls, but they crashed in the city. They were taken to the hospital, where Sam had abdominal injuries from the crash. They took him into surgery and got a consult for his heart. In surgery, they removed his spleen and part of his liver, so when his ventricle ruptured, he couldn't be put on bypass to fix it. [[Maggie Pierce]] tried to sew in a graft, but it didn't work, so she glued in the graft instead. That was successful and he was stable in the ICU after his surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Kate Shaw]]====\nSam met Kate through a dating app which allows you to say what kind of date you want to go on.
