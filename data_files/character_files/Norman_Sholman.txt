Levi examined her and said he believed she had a bowel obstruction. Norman then told Levi that Irene also had colorectal cancer. He ordered a CT scan, which showed multiple mets in her liver and lungs as well as the obstruction. Meredith told Irene she wasn't confident she'd recover from surgery, so they offered her palliative care.\n\nWanting to do something special for Irene, her husband Norman enlisted the help of Levi and some other residents to make the cafeteria into a dance floor. They disconnected her oxygen and draped a gown around her and she and Norman danced around the floor.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Irene Sholman]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have at least two children and one grandson together.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*His tux is named Mr. Grant.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x13-14.jpg\n16x13-15.jpg\n16x13-48.jpg\n16x13-49.jpg\n16x13-50.jpg\n16x13-51.jpg\n16x13-52.jpg\n16x13-53.jpg\n16x13-54.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sholman, Norman}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
