Bonnie didn't immediately realize the full extent of her injuries but after an [[MRI]], the doctors discovered that the pole had severed Bonnie's spinal cord and was unable to move her own feet. Because the injuries were more extensive, it was almost definite that she would die when the pole was removed. She went into surgery with Tom and asked [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] to say goodbye to her fianc\u00e9 if she died and asked Tom quietly if he believed in heaven. When the pole was removed, she began to bleed out and flatline and all the doctors but [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] abandoned her to work on Tom (who survived). However, it was clear that once Meredith stopped with the compressions that Bonnie would die so [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] stopped her and called the time of death.

In the afterlife, she kept reliving the day she died, bleeding from her abdomen and collapsing. By the time Meredith admitted that she'd stopped fighting to live, they worried that it might be too late for her. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe had a fianc\u00e9 named Danny who was flying out to [[Seattle]]. Before the surgery, she asked Derek to relay a message to him. Derek told Danny that she had said that if love were enough she would still be with him.\n\n===Friendships===\nBonnie was attached to Tom with a pole that stuck through them in a train accident. Because her injuries were more extensive, she was the one to die, though Tom's life was saved.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Bonnie's character and her story have an important psychological role in Meredith's life and her relationship with Derek. When Bonnie crashed, Meredith yelled to the other doctors (including Derek Shepherd) \"we can't just abandon her\", referring not only to Bonnie's situation but also to her personal situation, feeling abandoned by Derek. Bonnie appears in the limbo-like scene when Meredith is dead in Season 3 to remind her to fight for her own life--Meredith was the only one who fought for Bonnie's life, and it wasn't enough. Meredith is indifferent to dying, while Bonnie hardly had a choice. Her presence in the scene, however, gives Meredith some existential thoughts.\n*She was pronounced dead at 3:49.<ref>[[Into You Like a Train]], 2x06</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n206BonnieCrasnoff.png|[[Into You Like a Train]]\n317BonnieCrasnoff.png|[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n3x17-16.jpg\n3x17-18.jpg\n3x17-20.jpg\n3x17-22.jpg\n3x17-23.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Bonnie Crasnoff Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crasnoff, Bonnie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
