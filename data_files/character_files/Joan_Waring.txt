They believed she was their daughter, Shannon, whose husband had left her while she was pregnant and she had chased after him, which was the last time they'd heard from her. The blood type matched and Jane Doe had had her tonsils removed like their daughter, so they came in to visit her. During the visit, they told her all about Shannon's life. However, at some point, Joan figured out that Jane Doe wasn't actually Shannon. She and her husband left without breaking the news to Jane Doe.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Frank Waring]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband have a daughter, Shannon.
