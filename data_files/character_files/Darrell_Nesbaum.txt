He challenged the doctors to complete 20 of them faster than the other doctors. While they worked, he complimented Meredith's technique. He said that Bailey's technique was a little sloppy because she was rushing. She redid it and it was pronounced perfect by Darrell.\n\nRather than use the technique Darrell developed, Richard did it his own way and explained why he did it. When Richard started questioning the purpose, he got Darrell to say that the patients don't matter, turning all the doctors in the room against him.\n\n==Career==\nDarrell works teaching doctors a standardized method for operating.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n9x13-2.jpg\n9x13-3.jpg\n9x13-7.jpg\n9x13-9.jpg\n9x13-15.jpg\n9x13-20.jpg\n9x13-21.jpg\n9x13-22.jpg\n9x13-24.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nesbaum, Darrell}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
