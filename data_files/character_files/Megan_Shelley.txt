Because of this, they decided to get prophylactic gastrectomies.\n\nWhen he heard about the possible side effects of the surgery, Mike backed out and Megan briefly backed out as well. However, after they found stage I cancer during Tricia's surgery, Megan agreed to have hers. The surgery went well and she was awake and said the pain was minimal afterward.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nDue to the gastric cancer gene running in their family, the Shelley family was down to a branch. They had lost their mother, grandfather, aunt, and uncle to the disease and had a cousin in hospice care.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 27 at the time of her gastrectomy.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shelley, Megan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Genetics)]]"}}}]}}}}
