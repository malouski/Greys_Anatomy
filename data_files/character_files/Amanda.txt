When admitted to hospital, she held his hand as much as she could.\n\n==History==\n===Bus Accident===\n[[File:5x24-22.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Amanda stays with George.]]\nAmanda was admitted to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] after [[George O'Malley|a man]] pushed her out of the way from a bus. The man was dragged by the bus and by the time the bus driver had stopped, his face was unrecognisable. Paramedics brought the John Doe and Amanda to the hospital.\n\nAlthough she had ignored him at the bus stop because he was average-looking, as he began to crash and the doctors attempted to save him, she refused to leave him alone, but was removed from the room after she vomited. Later her arm was stitched up by [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] and then Mark and she gave [[Mark Sloan|Mark]] tips on how to be the woman in a relationship.\n\nFor the rest of the day, she stayed as close to the John Doe as possible and up until just before his surgery, she held his hand. When [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] told her she had to leave because they were taking him to surgery, she cried and walked away to the waiting room. Meredith noted that he ''\"...made a good friend there. Guess that's what happens when you take a bus for someone.\"'' ''(\"[[Now or Never]]\")''\n\n===George's Death===\nAfter everyone discovered it was George, she continued to wait by his bedside and apologize. She attended his funeral and cried harder than his mother. After the funeral, she suffered from insomnia. She saw George at night and at bus stops. She came into the hospital, where Meredith prescribed her anti-anxiety drugs to help her sleep. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\nEvery day, she went to Seattle Grace and sat at the benches outside. More than a month after his death, [[Izzie Stevens|Izzie]] saw Amanda sitting on the bench and called her out for wasting the life George saved and she finally left. ''(\"[[Goodbye]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nAmanda is a single girl and shortly before George O'Malley saved her life, she had been looking for guys at the bus stop but ignored George because she thought he was only average-looking.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Kaley Cuoco was originally cast to play Amanda but due to commitments with ''The Big Bang Theory'', she was not available and [[Shannon Lucio]] was chosen instead.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n524Amanda.png|[[Now or Never]]\n6x01Amanda.png|[[Good Mourning]]\n6x02Amanda.png|[[Goodbye]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n5x24-7.jpg\n5x24-10.jpg\n5x24-11.jpg\n5x24-16.jpg\n5x24-22.jpg\n5x24-31.jpg\n5x24-60.jpg\n6x01-4.jpg\n6x01-21.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Amanda (Now or Never) Appearances}}\n[[de:Amanda]]\n[[fr:Amanda]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
