They took her into surgery to remove some of the mets in her lungs, but they found that they'd adhered to chest wall, meaning she was terminal. They removed a tumor that had been obstructing her airway, which allowed her to breathe more easily, but they advised her that she was going to die.\n\nShe told them she wanted them to go back in and cut out whatever she could to give her as much time as possible because her daughter didn't know she had cancer. They said any additional surgery would be too much stress on her body.\n\nBeatrice tried to leave the hospital against medical advice because her daughter's birthday was the next day and she knew it would be the last birthday they spent together and didn't want it to celebrate it in the hospital. Alex convinced her to stay by saying she didn't want to risk dying in front of her daughter, who wasn't even aware she was sick.\n\nShe later told her daughter that she was sick and gave her all the advice she would have given her over the years.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe has a daughter, [[Amelia Carver|Amelia]]. When she was diagnosed with cancer, she didn't tell her daughter. Even when she was told she was going to die, she wanted to hide her diagnosis from Amelia. She later told her daughter and gave her all the advice she was going to give her over the years.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x22-10.jpg\n2x22-13.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carver, Beatrice}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
