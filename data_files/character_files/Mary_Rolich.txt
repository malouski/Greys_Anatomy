[[Meredith Grey]], who delivered Emma, heard about Mary's tumor and passed the scans on to [[Lexie Grey|Lexie]] to show to [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]].\n\n===Tumor Removal===\nWhen Derek saw the scans, he went to Clay and Mary and told them he believed he could remove Mary's tumor. Mary was excited and eager to have the surgery, but Clay resisted, saying that Emma needed the six months she had left with her mother and the surgery could take away those six months. After a conversation with Meredith, Clay came around and Mary had the surgery. Despite it being more difficult than Derek initially thought, he was able to proceed and the surgery was successful.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Clay Rolich]]. Together, they have one daughter, [[Emma Rolich]].\n\n===Familial===\nWhen she was diagnosed with a brain tumor thought to be inoperable, she and her husband decided to have a baby. Their daughter, Emma, was born two weeks before her due date.\n\n===Friendships===\nClay and Mary have a neighbor named Diane Schiffman whom Mary said would make a great wife and she was great with the kids at a block party. Clay claimed it was because she was always drunk. He then said another neighbor, Wendy McDowell, was too uptight. He then proposed Erin Miller, but was told she's way too hot for him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She lives in Olympia, Washington.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rolich, Mary}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
