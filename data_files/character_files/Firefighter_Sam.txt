He came into the OR where Nathan was operating and tried to get them to leave. Nathan refused and Meredith said they were working as fast as they could. They thought they could finish in around fifteen minutes, so Sam said he'd give them that much time to finish. He was also present in the lab where they found [[Keith|Keith's]] burned body.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a firefighter with [[Seattle Fire Department]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sam, Fighterfighter}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Firefighters]]"}}}]}}}}
