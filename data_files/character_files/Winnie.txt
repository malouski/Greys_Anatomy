Sarah and Winnie's car landed on its side. Sarah became worried because Winnie wasn't answering her and she couldn't see her, but she was just not speaking because she thought she was dead. Derek found them and showed Winnie how to check her pulse to show that she's not dead. Derek used a tire iron to break out the back window of their car to retrieve a first aid kit they had back there and then guided Winnie out of the vehicle. He tried to send Winnie over to Charlie and [[Alana]] with some bandages to get her out of the way while he tended to Sarah, but she told him that she had seen her father die right in front of her and she wasn't afraid to see pain. Despite this, she agreed to go sit by Charlie and Alana.\n\nWhen Charlie's car caught on fire, Winnie was the first one to notice and alerted Derek, who told Alana to get away from it and helped Charlie walk away. Winnie then helped Derek tend to Alana's abdominal injuries and sat with him while they waited to be rescued, as he told her the smoke from the car would lead people right to them.\n\nWinnie went with her mom in the ambulance to the hospital and Derek said he'd come visit them in the hospital first thing in the morning.\n\nWhen Derek arrived in the ER at [[Dillard Medical Center]] while her mother's injuries were being tended, Winnie recognized him and went to him. She checked the pulse at his wrist, noting that he was still alive and telling him to stay not dead. She then told the doctors, who were treating Derek as a John Doe, his name and that he was a surgeon who saved all of them after the car accident.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWinnie's father died right in front of her while they were on a lake fishing.\n\n===Friendships===\nWinnie and Derek meet while he saved her and her mother from their car after their car crashed in front of him. He taught her to find her pulse and his \"[[It's a Beautiful Night to Save Lives]]\" phrase, which she later repeated back to him in the hospital. When asked by a doctor if Derek was a family member or neighbor, Winnie said that he was her friend and that he'd saved everyone. She was one of the last people to see Derek before his death.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
