He approached Tim by talking about his son Howie, whom Derek had seen in daycare. He used Howie as a way to make Tim interested in keeping the ER open, saying the ER was just downstairs if Howie swallowed something and choked in the hospital daycare. This made Tim realize that the ER was important and he listened to the rest of Derek's plan. They walked around the hospital while Derek told him\u00a0[[Dermatology|dermatology]]\u00a0would need to cut one its two\u00a0[[Fellow|fellows]]\u00a0to make his plan work.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nTim has a son named Howie, who stayed in the hospital daycare while his dad was at work.
