He participated in a resident skills lab regarding the case of [[Wade Foltz]]. He and Andrew made the diagnosis faster than the other residents, but during the practical part of the lab, he didn't win entry into the surgery, having been beaten by both [[Taryn Helm]] and [[Andrew DeLuca]]. Instead of that surgery, he went to the ER and helped work on [[Reid Kim]] while they were attempting to resuscitate him. He left that case when Tom came in and told him to go to another room where they weren't wasting time trying to save a patient who was already dead. ''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Article===\nWhen an article came out that condemned the healthcare industry, stemming from a list of possible article topics Meredith floated to a publisher, the residents discussed it in the locker room while getting ready for their days. Taryn liked the article and said Meredith was a badass for writing it, but Blake warned them that while he had Hopkins and Koracick on his resum\u00e9, they might have difficulty finding other jobs. ''(\"[[It's Raining Men]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Hearing===\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing, Blake and the other residents were told they'd have to up their game to make up for the missing attendings. At the end of the day, the residents were all exhausted from the extra work they'd done. Blake then announced that Levi had been the one to turn Meredith's fraud in, turning the other residents against him. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Return to Work===\nOn Meredith's first day back at work, Blake and the other residents greeted her with a cake. Afterward, they went on rounds, where they worked on the case of [[Jamie Caldwell]], which Blake followed to its end. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\n===Bar Crash===\nWhile Blake was at the bar with some other residents, a car crashed through a window and into the bar. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")''\n\nBlake was seriously injured in the crash, with multiple facial fractures and bleeding that was obstructing his airway. They moved him to his side and packed his nose, but he later started choking on the blood, forcing them to do a cricothyrotomy to give him an airway. They ventilated him and when the firefighters finally got a doorway unblocked, he was the first patient put on a gurney and pulled out to get to the hospital. ''(\"[[I Know This Bar]]\")''\n\nBlake was taken to the ER, where they did a head CT, which showed no traumatic brain injuries. They rushed him into surgery to repair his facial fractures. After they were finished, they went to stitch him back up, but Owen noticed clear fluid around a blood stain, indicating a leak of cerebrospinal fluid. Tom found the source of the leak and repaired it. His grandmother was then told that he'd be okay. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\n===Suzanne Britland===\nBlake and the other residents were assigned to look into every possible diagnosis for [[Suzanne Britland]]. They gathered in Taryn's hospital room and went over every possible explanation for her symptoms. ''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\n===Blizzard===\nDuring the blizzard, Blake helped Jackson treat several cases of frostbite in the emergency room. When Andrew came back to the hospital after walking to and from Seattle Pres to retrieve a liver for [[Elisa Tang]], he had frostbite in his fingers and Blake was tasked with preparing a bath of warm saline to warm his hands back up. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\n===Brad Spencer===\nBlake worked on the case of [[Brad Spencer]], who had fallen onto train tracks and been electrocuted. When they determined Brad needed fasciotomies, Blake did one of his arms. ''(\"[[Life on Mars?]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe has been raised by his grandmother since his parents died. ''(\"[[Help Me Through the Night]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe is a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] who works under [[Tom Koracick]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He appears with no dialogue in both [[I Know This Bar]] and [[Help Me Through the Night]], due to his facial injuries.\n*He thinks being liked is overrated.<ref>[[It's Raining Men]], 16x04</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x02BlakeSimms.png|[[Back in the Saddle]]\n16x04BlakeSimms.png|[[It's Raining Men]]\n16x08BlakeSimms.png|[[My Shot]]\n16x09BlakeSimms.png|[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\nS193x01BlakeSimms.png|[[I Know This Bar]]\n16x10BlakeSimms.png|[[Help Me Through the Night]]\n16x13BlakeSimms.png|[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\n16x15BlakeSimms.png|[[Snowblind]]\n16x17BlakeSimms.png|[[Life on Mars?]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x09-5.jpg\n16x09-9.jpg\n16x09-13.jpg\n16x09-14.jpg\n16x09-23.jpg\n16x09-24.jpg\n16x09-31.jpg\n16x09-33.jpg\n16x09-34.jpg\n16x09-41.jpg\nS193x01-7.jpg\nS193x01-58.jpg\nS193x01-61.jpg\n16x10-49.jpg\n16x10-54.jpg\n16x10-56.jpg\n16x13-37.jpg\n16x13-38.jpg\n16x13-40.jpg\n16x13-41.jpg\n16x15-23.jpg\n16x15-45.jpg\n16x15-46.jpg\n16x15-47.jpg\n16x15-53.jpg\n16x15-56.jpg\n16x15-57.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Blake Simms Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Simms, Blake}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
