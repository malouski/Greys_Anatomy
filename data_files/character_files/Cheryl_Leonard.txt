As a result of this accident, he was believed to be in a permanent vegetative state and he was put in residential care.\n\n===Holden's Fall, Awakening, and Death===\nSixteen years later, Holden fell in his nursing home while being turned by orderlies and insurance insisted that he be checked out in an ER before he could be returned to the home. While she was examining him and preparing to stitch up a cut on his forehead, Meredith was startled to see him open his eyes and track her. She told Derek what she saw and he was doubtful. Despite his doubts, he examined Holden, who was found to be minimally conscious. Derek gave him amphetamines to wake him up.\n\nThey also called his family as they waited for him to wake up. When the family arrived, they discovered that his son was now a teenager and his wife had re-married and was expecting a baby. When they heard that Holden was likely to wake up soon, Cheryl took [[Coby McKee|Coby]] and left, not wanting Holden to see that they hadn't waited for him.\n\nAfter they left, Holden woke up and was shocked to hear how much time had passed. He had an MRI, which revealed an epidural hematoma. They said they could operate, but told Holden it was risky. Coby came back, but didn't stay long. After he left, Holden decided to have the surgery. They operated, but he died during the surgery. Meredith then had to deliver the news to Coby, who had come back to the hospital to wait for his dad.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Holden McKee]]====\nCheryl was married to Holden McKee and they had one son together. When their son was a toddler, Holden was injured and had to be put in a nursing home. At some point, Cheryl divorced Holden and remarried.\n\n====[[Hal Leonard]]====\nAt some point while Holden was in the nursing home, Cheryl re-married to Hal Leonard. They were also expecting a child together.\n\n===Familial===\nShe has one son, [[Coby McKee|Coby]] and is expecting another child.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leonard, Cheryl}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
