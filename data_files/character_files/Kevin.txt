When she finally went into labor, she was upset because her water had broken, but labor wasn't progressing. Since an epidural had nearly killed her two years prior during her first delivery, that wasn't an option. An allergy to pitocin eliminated that option, meaning she just had to labor slowly in the hospital.\n\nAfter twenty hours of labor, trying many things to progress her labor, [[Carina DeLuca]] suggested clitoral stimulation with climax to induce the release of oxytocin. Arizona was reluctant to suggest that, but when Marnie and Kevin asked for any other option to avoid a c-section, she eventually suggested it. With a little help from Kevin, Marnie was quickly crowning.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Marnie]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have a two year old and are expecting their second child.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
