An initial diagnosis of cholecystitis was made and she was brought into the OR for a cholecystectomy. Once inside, Bailey and Grey saw that she had a 'porcelain gallbladder', which is a sign of gallbladder cancer. Pathology confirmed that Esme had advanced gallbladder cancer and with treatment had between four and six months to live.\n\nUpon hearing the diagnosis, Jed told Grey and Bailey not to tell Esme as she was so happy. However Grey later told Esme, who informed her not to tell Jed as they are both looking forward to a trip to Venice at the end of the month where they plan to ride a gondola under the 'Bridge of Sighs' which according to popular belief will unite a couple forever.\n\nEsme later left the hospital with Jed.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe's been married to [[Jed Sorento]] for over 60 years.
