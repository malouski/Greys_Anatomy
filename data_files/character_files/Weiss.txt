When the test came back positive, he and Savvy few out to Seattle so that Addison could remove her uterus and ovaries and a plastic surgeon could remove her breasts. Savvy was sure of her decision, but Weiss struggled with it, not wanting her to take such drastic measures when she did not yet have cancer. They fought over it, but she said she wouldn't change her mind, so when she showed up at the hospital for her surgery, Weiss wasn't there. However, after a talk with Derek, Weiss eventually came and held her hand as she was anesthetized for her surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Savannah]]. Their marriage was strained when her mother's death caused her to get tested for the BRCA gene, a test that came back positive. It seemed like Weiss might leave her after she chose to have her uterus, ovaries, and breasts removed even though they'd been trying for a child, but he ultimately came through and stayed by her side.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe and his wife are close friends with [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] and [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]].\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
