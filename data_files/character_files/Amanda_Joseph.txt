When an ultrasound in the prison hospital showed TRAP syndrome, they went to court to get [[Arizona Robbins]], [[Miranda Bailey]], and [[Jo Wilson]] to come to the hospital to treat her. Their request was granted and the doctors came to the hospital. Amanda met them at security and fast-tracked their entry into the hospital prison. Once there, they met up with [[Dominique Eldredge]] and Amanda pressured Eldredge to take them directly to Kristen.\n\nAmanda asked for continuous confirmation that Kristen's rights were being respected, from being fed properly to what level of force and restraint the guards were allowed to use with her. She was able to calm Kristen down after she attacked Eldredge and was restrained for that. However, she was called away to handle an issue with another client, leaving the doctors alone with Kristen.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nShe had a good professional relationship with her client Kristen. She said Kristen always behaved for her and she was able to calm Kristen down after she became agitated with Eldredge for refusing to give her more food.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a defense lawyer. Her clients consist at least partially of incarcerated individuals.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x10-2.jpg\n13x10-3.jpg\n13x10-4.jpg\n13x10-5.jpg\n13x10-15.jpg\n13x10-16.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joseph, Amanda}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
