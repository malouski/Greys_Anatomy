When Dale, Andy, and Jack were found, they were brought to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] to be treated. However, Lonnie remained missing. At the hospital, when they told the story, they said that Lonnie was dead and they had to leave him behind so they could get to a place where they could be rescued.\n\nJack had a spinal injury, but he had feeling in his feet, which was a good sign. However, he had bone fragments in his spine and needed surgery to remove them. ''(\"[[Testing 1-2-3]]\")''\n\nWhen the learned that Lonnie had been found alive, they started telling a story, saying that Lonnie started climbing down while they were trying to climb up, leading all four of them to be suspended mid-air because they were tied together. While they were falling, Andy's ax hit Lonnie in the head and they thought he was dead, so they left him.\n\nWhen Derek discovered that that story was a lie as the ax was imbedded deeply and cleanly into Lonnie's skull, he confronted the other hikers. Andy started to confess, but was silenced. Andy quickly hired a lawyer to counsel him. However, despite his lawyer's advice, he told what really happened. Lonnie was dying and Andy tried to put him out of his misery. ''(\"[[Didn't We Almost Have It All?]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nDale, Jack, Andy, and Lonnie are friends.
