He was ineligible for liver transplant, so Meredith planned a procedure that involved rerouting blood flow through one side of the liver, allowing it to grow more healthy tissue while depriving the cancerous side. A second surgery would remove the cancerous part. His initial surgery went well, but later that day, he threw a clot and despite Meredith's best efforts, he died.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married until his wife died of a aneurysm suddenly, eight years prior to his own death.\n\n===Professional===\nHe has a very good working relationship with [[Robert Souza]], whom he mentored.
