He was in the hospital for another surgery. When his doctor, [[Jordan Kenley]], died while examining him, his case was taken over by [[Arizona Robbins]], who didn't believe the current course of treatment was the right one and instead changed his treatment plan. Bailey told Melinda about this change and said that Jackson had a crackerjack new doctor. ''(\"[[Wish You Were Here]]\")''\n\nAs Jackson's condition continued to decline, Melinda had to fight constantly with the insurance company, causing Jackson to ask Bailey to tell her something good that day, even if nothing good happened. When a set of organs became available, the doctors retrieved them and went to transplant them, but a black spot on the tissue meant that organs were unsuitable for transplant. They did a portacaval shunt to buy some time and closed. ''(\"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\")''\n\nWhen Jackson's ICP continued to rise despite them putting him on liver dialysis, Melinda begged him to keep fighting, saying it wasn't time for him to go yet. His condition deteriorated and Melinda began to believe he was going to die. Bailey told her to come be with him because the time had come. So she held him and rocked him and said it was okay to go. However, Webber then came in to tell them they'd found organs. Jackson was rushed into surgery for the transplant. The transplant was successful and Melinda sat by his bedside afterward. He later woke up and asked for water. ''(\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer son, Jackson, was hospitalized with liver and bowel disease. She worked very hard to make sure he had everything he needed.\n\n===Professional===\nShe and [[Miranda Bailey]] bonded during her son's hospitalizations and got along well.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n511MelindaPrescott.png|[[Wish You Were Here]]\n512MelindaPrescott.png|[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\n513MelindaPrescott.png|[[Stairway to Heaven]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Melinda Prescott Appearances}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prescott, Melinda}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
