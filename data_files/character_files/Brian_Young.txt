His father had a hard time accepting that and believed Jackson and April were coming to save Brian's life.

He initially refused, but when Jackson talked about losing his own son and trying to find some meaning in it, Eric agreed to donate his organs. They wanted to retrieve his throat to transplant into [[Caroline Hodges]], but there was a lesion in his throat that made it ineligible for transplant.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis father took him skiing on his tenth birthday, which he loved.
