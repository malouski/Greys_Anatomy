After two years of fertility treatments, however, Julie was finally pregnant. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with vasa previa during pregnancy and fetal surgery was planned to correct the problem.\n\nBefore she could be taken in for surgery, Julie's blood pressure dropped and she started bleeding. There was no detectable fetal heartbeat, so they did a crash c-section in her hospital room. Despite their best efforts, her baby did not survive.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n[[File:11x13JulieHallHusband.png|thumb|257px|left]]\nJulie is married to a man named Mark.
