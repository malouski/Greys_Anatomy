She later told Bailey that the hospital had been understaffed with nurses. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\n===Calling Out Alex and Jo===\nWhen Alex and Jo starting making out in his office at the end of the day, Frankie yelled to them that it's not a private space and others could see them. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n===Pregnancy Complications and Death===\nWhen she was 28 weeks pregnant, she collapsed. Her spleen was twisted, but she refused surgery because she was worried about her baby. She had had three rounds of IVF and a miscarriage in order to have her baby, whom she called her last shot. Her spleen started to un-twist, but then she had abdominal bleeding, so she was rushed into surgery. In surgery, the bleed was stopped, but then Frankie crashed, so they did an emergency c-section to deliver her son. After that, they tried to resuscitate her but they were unsuccessful. Richard then delivered the news of her death to the other nurses, who all mourned her. The nurses then watched over her son in the NICU.
