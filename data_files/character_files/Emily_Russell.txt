She was diagnosed in utero with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, meaning she'd need to have surgery shortly after birth. When their mother was 32 weeks pregnant, she was hospitalized until she was ready to deliver, which she hoped would not be until 36 weeks. However, she started having contractions at just 32 weeks. They put her in trendellenberg and put her on magnesium to try to stop the labor. Despite their efforts, her placenta started tearing, forcing them to deliver all five babies at 32 weeks. ''(\"[[Much too Much]]\")''\n\n===Infancy and Death===\nAfter birth, Burke used a catheter to open Emily's atrial septum. Then they planned a surgery to reconstruct the left side of her heart. In surgery, they found that her aorta was narrower than they thought, so they closed without doing anything. Addison decided to use her as a teaching tool for Izzie, so she told Izzie to keep Emily alive overnight, lying that Burke thought she had a chance if she could make it through the next ten hours. Despite Izzie's efforts, Emily died early the next morning. ''(\"[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe is part of a set of quintuplets. Their parents also have a set of triplets.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was the only Russell quintuplet to die.\n*She had the hiccups almost every day in utero.<ref>[[Much too Much]], 2x10</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Appearances===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x10EmilyRussell.png|[[Much too Much]]\n2x11EmilyRussell.png|[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Emily Russell Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Russell, Emily}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neonatal)]]"}}}]}}}}
