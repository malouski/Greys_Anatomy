Abraham grew frustrated at Logan's refusal to accept proper medical care. Later, after his condition became worse, Logan's arm spasmed so hard that it snapped. He had to be taken in to surgery to re-break a previous break that hadn't properly healed so they could properly align the new break. The bone was held in place by rods and plates. When the doctors told him that, Abraham asked for a list of all the materials they had put into his brother's organic, grass-fed body.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\n====Father====\nLogan and Abraham's father died when they were young, done in by corn beef hash and cigarettes. Since his death, Logan has become obsessed with what he puts into his body, even medical treatments.\n\n====[[Logan Treadwell]]====\nAbraham loves his brother, but he gets frustrated by how seriously Logan takes the health nut thing.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Treadwell, Abraham}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
