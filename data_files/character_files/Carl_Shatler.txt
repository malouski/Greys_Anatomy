He was taken to the ER. His hand was badly injured in the accident and [[Callie Torres|Callie]] believed he would lose part of it. However, while she was attempting to stabilize his hand, she was pushed out of the trauma room by [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] who told her that the hand wasn't the priority.\n\nAfter Owen cleared him, he was sent back to Callie, who informed Carl that he'd probably lose two of his fingers. However, when she found out that he does wood carvings in his spare time, she developed a plan that would allow him to keep his fingers. While she was operating, Carl went into cardiac tamponade. Cristina came into the OR and diagnosed an aortic dissection, which Callie deduced was the reason why he fell off the truck in the first place. His heart was repaired in surgery while Callie continued to work on his hand.\n\nAfter surgery, Carl was pleased to see all of his fingers still attached. Callie warned him that he'd need more surgery and lots of physical therapy, but that he'd be able to keep his hand.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married. When he found out the extent of his hand injuries, he called his wife and warned Callie that his wife would probably freak out.\n\n==Career==\nCarl Shatler works as a sanitation worker. He was working when he fell off a garbage truck and was run over by a car. He says he has a lot of down time on his job, which he uses to make wood carvings.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He makes wood carvings as a hobby.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shatler, Carl}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
