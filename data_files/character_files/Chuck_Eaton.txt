Chemotherapy and radiation had done little to shrink his tumor, so he had to have a very risky en bloc tumor resection. He was given only a 25% chance of surviving the surgery, but he decided to go ahead with it.\n\nBefore his surgery, he recorded several videos of himself to his family and friends. Meredith thought they'd be happy goodbye videos, but was shocked when they were hateful goodbyes to people who had wronged him over the years. She helped him for a while, but then said she needed to prep him for surgery.\n\nChuck's surgery went well and he was awake afterward. Meredith offered to throw away the tapes, but he told her to mail them anyway because he needs to speak his peace.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe dated a woman named Suzie in college, whom he called the love of his life. She went on to marry a guy and had children that Chuck said were ugly.\n\n===Familial===\nChuck harbored a grudge against his older brother for going after a girl he knew that Chuck liked.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 54 at the time of his surgery.\n*He was a smoker.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eaton, Chuck}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
