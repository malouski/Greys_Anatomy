However, the landing of the hot air balloon went badly and he ended up in the hospital with abdominal trauma and a broken leg as well as flash burns to his arms. His burns were debrided in the ER and then he was taken into surgery. After surgery, Jamie was told he would have to use a wheelchair or maybe crutches, but he could still go to homecoming. Jamie was surprised that news had spread and made her popular, giving her several other options for homecoming dates and so wasn't sure she'd accept. April talked to her and told her she should go for the boy who had put so much into making it special for her.
