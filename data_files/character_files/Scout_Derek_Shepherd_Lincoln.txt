''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")'' When she learned that she was, she told Link and they celebrated their impending parenthood. ''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\nHer pregnancy continued until Amelia went to an appointment at what she believed to be her 20th week and learned that she was actually 24 weeks pregnant, injecting doubt into the paternity. ''(\"[[Let's All Go to the Bar]]\")'' She had a paternity test done and when Link came to her and said he didn't care if he was the father or not, he still wanted to be with her, she told him that he was the father. ''(\"[[Life on Mars?]]\")''\n\nLate in her pregnancy, Amelia had to leave a surgery abruptly because she believed she was in labor. She was surprised to learn that she wasn't and the contractions were just Braxton Hicks. ''(\"[[Sing It Again]]\")''\n\n===Birth===\nWhile working on Richard's case, Amelia quickly said she needed Tom to take over and then revealed that her water had just broken. She walked to OB, where Carina examined her and said she was five centimeters dilated. She admitted she'd been having contractions all day, but believed they were Braxton Hicks again, so she ignored them. Carina confirmed that she was actually in active labor and monitored her progress. When she was at six centimeters, Link was called away to operate on Richard's hip. While he was gone, Bailey took over coaching and when the time came for Amelia to push, she sat herself behind Amelia's back to help her as George had done for [[As We Know It|her]]. When Link came into the room later, he met his son. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\nAfter his birth, his parents struggled to pick a name for him. His aunt [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] suggested they name him Tony, which his Dad was not a fan of. The considered several different names before eventually deciding on Scout. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")''\n\n===COVID-19 Pandemic===\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Scout was looked after by his parents, [[Maggie Pierce|Maggie]], and Meredith and spent time with his cousins Zola, Bailey, and Ellis. ''(\"[[The Center Won't Hold]]\")'' During this time, his Dad frequently played guitar for him and his cousins. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n===Play Date===\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, [[Leo Hunt|Leo]], [[Allison Hunt|Allison]], and Scout all had a play date together with [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] and Amelia supervising. At the end of the day, [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n===Visiting Mt. Rainier===\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n===One-Year Checkup===\nScout went to [[James Shulman]] for his one-year checkup, where he weighed 21 pounds and was 26 inches long. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n===Parents' Split===\nWhen his parents split up over conflicting desires regarding marriage, Scout began staying at [[Jo's Penthouse]] with his father when he was with him. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis parents were surprised to learn of his existence but were happy to be parents.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Like [[Harriet Kepner-Avery]], he has an older brother who died before he was born.\n*He was named after his late uncle [[Derek Shepherd]] and Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch, the main protagonist from ''To Kill A Mockingbird''.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n16x21BabyLincoln.png|[[Put on a Happy Face]]\n17x02ScoutDerekShepherdLincoln.png|[[The Center Won't Hold]]\n17x03ScoutDerekShepherdLincoln.png|[[My Happy Ending]]\n17x07ScoutDerekShepherdLincoln.png|[[Helplessly Hoping]]\n17x16ScoutDerekShepherdLincoln.png|[[I'm Still Standing]]\n18x01ScoutDerekShepherdLincoln.png|[[Here Comes the Sun]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x21-22.jpg\n16x21-23.jpg\n16x21-24.jpg\n16x21-25.jpg\n16x21-26.jpg\n16x21-27.jpg\n16x21-28.jpg\n16x21-29.jpg\n16x21-30.jpg\n16x21-31.jpg\n16x21-33.jpg\n16x21-34.jpg\n17x07-23.jpg\n17x07-24.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Scout Derek Shepherd Lincoln Appearances}}\n\n[[de:Baby Lincoln]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lincoln, Scout Derek Shepherd}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
