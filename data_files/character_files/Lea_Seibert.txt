A car had cut her Bob off and he, in a rage, caused an accident. The driver of the other car involved died and Bob was left in critical condition. Lea and Scott had only minor injuries and had to be monitored, but Bob was seriously injured and had to be taken into surgery. Even before the accident, he was in liver failure and his condition was worsened by the car accident. While the doctors were operating, they asked about a potential donor. Scott had been tested as a match, but hadn't agreed to be a donor. Lea pressured her son to donate, as they were informed that Bob wouldn't survive the surgery without a transplant. After speaking with [[Alex Karev|Alex]] about his own experience, Scottie agreed to donate, but only on the condition that he and his mom moved out of the house and she told the police everything her husband had been doing to her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Bob Seibert]]. He is an alcoholic who beats her. She had multiple healed injuries revealed when she was in a car accident. As part of the agreement to get her son to donate a portion of his liver to save his life, she had to leave him and tell the police what he'd been doing to her.\n\n===Familial===\nShe has one son, Scott. When her husband needed a liver transplant, Scottie started counseling to talk to him about donating a portion of his. He agreed to donate only if his mom agreed to leave his dad.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 43 at the time of the car accident.\n*In the original script, her first name was Lin.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seibert, Lea}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
