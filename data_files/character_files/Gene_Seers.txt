However, after seeing his PET scan results, she determined that surgery was no longer an option. He refused to accept that and pushed her to come up with a new treatment plan, trying to get her to play chess to get her mind working. She was unable to do that and offered him brochures for hospice facilities. He refused to allow her to glorify death. He said that he\u2019s not going to a better place. It\u2019s not going to be comfortable. He\u2019s just going to cease to exist.\n\n===Moving to Richard\u2019s Room===\nIn order to push both of them to accept their realities, Bailey had Gene moved in [[Richard Webber|Richard Webber's]] room. Gene began to look through the brochures, but made fun of all the facilities, much to Richard\u2019s annoyance. He ultimately gave Richard the push to start working out his lungs and Richard in turn made him realize that he doesn\u2019t want to die in the hospital, so he should choose a place to go.\n\n==Personality==\nGene has a very caustic personality. He makes highly offensive comments about all the people around him, such as calling a Filipino nurse \u201coriental\u201d. He used to play Chess in the park, but the people he played with wouldn\u2019t allow him to continue playing because of his offensive comments.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seers, Gene}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
