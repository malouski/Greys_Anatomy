After three months of chemotherapy, which he hid from his mother, the doctors were ready for the next step of his treatment: removing the cancerous portion of his leg and then turning his lower leg around and attaching it to the upper part, making his ankle take the place of his knee. The hope was that with prosthetics and rehab, he'd be able to play baseball again. His surgery went well and, while his leg looked odd to him at first, the doctors were hopeful that he'd be able to play as well as he'd played before.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe was upset that her son hadn't told her about his cancer. When she learned about it, she worried about him, but felt that if she freaked out, it would justify his not telling her.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martinez, Jenny}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
