Her condition rapidly declined, necessitating a liver transplant when she was only six. A liver became available, but was unable to be transported to the hospital due to a blizzard. [[Andrew DeLuca]] then offered to go retrieve the liver on foot, so that Elisa's life might be saved. While he was gone, Elisa's condition continued to decline and she hemorrhaged. They transfused blood and took her into surgery to place a shunt with the hope that it would stop the bleeding. The shunt worked and when the liver arrived, it was successfully transplanted. Her condition started to improve immediately and her parents were told she'd be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer older sister died of a liver condition that she also inherited.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was six at the time of her transplant.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tang, Elisa}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
