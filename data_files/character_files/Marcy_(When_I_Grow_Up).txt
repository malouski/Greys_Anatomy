While they were touring, a group of cops came in after a bank robbery resulted in three of them being shot. This derailed the kids' tour and they abruptly left the ER so the kids wouldn't see the injured cops. Marcy tried to get ahold of the bus driver to take the kids back to the school, but when she couldn't, the kids were taken to see the babies instead. Then [[Alex Karev]] showed them a scan of a patient who had a nail in his head and another with a coffee can in his abdomen. Marcy came in just as they were looking at that and said that the bus driver was back to take them back to school. She was upset that Alex showed them the picture of the coffee can.\n\nAs they went to leave the hospital, one of the students, [[Julie Hamilton]] went missing. They eventually found her in an OR gallery.\n\n==Career==\nMarcy is a fifth grade teacher. She took her class to the hospital on a field trip.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Marcy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
