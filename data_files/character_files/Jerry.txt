He was upset by this and wondered if they had botched the surgery, despite being told it was a success. He said that his life had been hard, but he'd always had the pleasure of being able to crap like clockwork, though now that had been taken away from him.\n\nEven after being given a laxative, Jerry still hadn't had a bowel movement. In order to encourage him to follow directions to get himself discharged, they put him in the same room as [[Harriet]], who'd had a face lift. When the doctors came to check on them later, they found them in bed together, having sex.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====Ex-Spouses====\nHe's been divorced twice.\n\n====[[Harriet]]====\nAfter being put in the same room as Harriet, the two ended up having sex.\n\n===Familial===\nHis children don't talk to him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He's battled addictions.\n*He once filed for bankruptcy.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
