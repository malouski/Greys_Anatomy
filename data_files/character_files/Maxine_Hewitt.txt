She was worried [[Lisa Wilcox|Lisa]] would be mad because they hadn't stuck the landing, which caused all their injuries. [[Danielle (All Eyez on Me)|Danielle]] hit her trick too soon, which knocked them all out of sync. Maxine had cuts on her face, but her pulse was racing and her BP was high, so they ordered cardiac testing. Amelia did a neuro exam, which was clear, but she decided to run a CT anyway. The CT showed a mild concussion. Alex recommended that she learn to control stress because of her BP. In the ER, her heart rate spiked and she lost pulse. She was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which caused her rapid heart rate. Due to the severity of her condition, she was rushed into surgery to repair it. She also had a stent placed when she became unstable. Her surgery went well and her parents were told she was stable afterward.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer parents always say she's high-strung.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe and [[Lisa Wilcox]] have been friends since elementary school. When Maxine started to get closer to [[Danielle (All Eyez on Me)|Danielle]], it made Lisa jealous.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 17 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hewitt, Maxine}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
