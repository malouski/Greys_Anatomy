She was diagnosed with heat stroke. Unfortunately, the heat stroke caused acute liver failure, necessitating a liver transplant. Her twin sister, Chandler, immediately offered to donate. She was tested as a potential donor, but her labs revealed that she was pregnant, making her ineligible to donate. A donor liver was coming to the hospital to be transplanted into [[June Crowley]], so June was approached about declining the liver so it could be re-allocated to Chelsea. June refused, so they gave Chelsea meds to buy her time as they waited for another potential donor to come in. [[Andrew Billings]], who had a cardiac tumor, was pronounced brain dead after his surgery and his liver was donated to Chelsea.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe and her twin sister, Chandler, are very close. When they were kids, they had a deal where if one of them was in trouble, the other would trade with her and go get yelled at in her sister's place. Her sister offered to donate a portion of her liver to her, but was ineligible due to pregnancy.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 25 at the time of her liver transplant.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keen, Chelsea}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
