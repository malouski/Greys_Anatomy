Tim and [[Lloyd]] from Kleiss Neuroscience were sent to Seattle to convince Derek to join their project. He declined their invitation outright, but was forced to stay and watch their full pitch. After the pitch, he still said he didn't have time for it. He also said their method wasn't going to work. They were too narrowly focused. While they were talking, he left the room and let them continue to talk about it. However, when the president himself later called, Derek was implored to accept and join the initiative.\n\n==Career==\nHe works for Kleiss Neuroscience.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Tim}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
