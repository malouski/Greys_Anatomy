He asked her first why she didn't just pay for the surgery herself. She explained that [[Gabriella Rivera]] needed more that just that surgery because she had cancer and she didn't think her father would accept Meredith's charity, nor should he have to. When he asked her if she regretted her actions, she paused before saying only as much as she can knowing there's a little girl who is finally feeling better. Finch sentenced her to community service picking up litter on the side of the road.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a judge in King County.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Finch, Judge}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
