Gretchen was more concerned with her husband and children's safety than her own. She had some abdominal pain, so she was taken into the ER, where her BP dropped. It came back up when they rolled her onto her side, so they propped her up that way. Arizona came in to examine her and said they both looked good, but she ordered a CT just to be safe. [[Jasmine Singh|Jasmine]] came in to see her while she waited, showing her Spencer's lost tooth. Gretchen told Jasmine she was in charge. The CT was clear, so Ben and Andrew prepared to move her up to OB. On the way, Gretchen started to complain of additional pain, so they propped her up even higher. A [[Hospital Codes#Code Pink|Code Pink]] was called, blocking them in the hallway just as they lost the fetal heartbeat. Ben had Andrew find a crash cart, which he then used to do a c-section in the hallway. After he had the baby delivered, Bailey found them. She stepped in to help Andrew stop Gretchen's bleeding while Ben took the baby to the NICU. Gretchen was rushed to the OR, where Arizona operated to try to stop the bleeding. Despite her best efforts, Gretchen was pronounced dead in the OR.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to [[Omar Singh]] until her death.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband had three kids and were expecting a fourth. The fourth was delivered while they were hospitalized, but died shortly after Gretchen herself.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 35 at the time of her death.\n*She was pronounced dead at 17:02.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n12x18-18.jpg\n12x18-20.jpg\n12x18-21.jpg\n12x18-22.jpg\n12x18-23.jpg\n12x18-31.jpg\n12x18-32.jpg\n12x18-33.jpg\n12x18-34.jpg\n12x18-35.jpg\n12x18-36.jpg\n12x18-37.jpg\n12x18-38.jpg\n12x18-39.jpg\n12x18-40.jpg\n12x18-41.jpg\n12x18-42.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McKay, Gretchen}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
