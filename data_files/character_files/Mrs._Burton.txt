Derek was against the idea, but Jake wanted the surgery. After convincing his parents, they signed the consent so he could have the surgery. They planned to do both procedures under the same round of anesthesia to make things easier on Jake's body.\n\nJake died during the tumor resection, but Alex and Cristina had the idea that Mark could still fix his face for his parents. After he was done, Jake's parents came in to see his body and cried.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Mr. Burton]].
