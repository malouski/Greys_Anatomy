She came out to say she knew it was Alex texting, but she agreed to speak with him only if he'd come into the bathroom with her. She tried to get him to put off the transplant as she wasn't ready, but he talked her into accepting the transplant, saying she needs to take the good things when they're in front of her. She agreed and the transplant went on as scheduled.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Mrs. Donovan]] and together, they have a daughter, [[Jaylen Donovan]].\n\n===Familial===\nHis daughter, Jaylen, was in kidney failure for three years before a transplant became available for her.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Donovan, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
