After seeing [[Megan Hunt]], he learned of the possibility of having an abdominal wall transplant, plus a penile and scrotum transplant. After his accident, he dumped her because he felt he'd lost his manhood, but he didn't tell anyone. When he was preparing to have his transplant, he pretended she was deployed and would be returning soon to help care for him. However, when she arrived at the hospital, he demanded that she leave and told the doctors not to tell her why she was there. Because he didn't have the support system required, his surgery was cancelled. However, Owen spoke to Caleb and convinced him to keep Anna by his side. Caleb then reunited with Anna and his surgery went forward as planned.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is engaged to [[Caleb Hicks]].
