Craniofacial special [[Lauren Boswell]] was flown to [[Seattle]] to work on his case. Scans determined that the encephalocele contained no brain matter, so it would just be removed and his skull reconstructed. The hope was that he would have no lasting defects. ''(\"[[Do You Believe in Magic]]\")''\n\nTyler's surgery was performed successfully and his parents were informed that he would only be left with a tiny scar on his forehead. ''(\"[[Readiness is All]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nTyler's parents were worried about the surgery, but were reassured by Arizona saying that she wasn't worried at all. Post-op, they were pleased with the result.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hide-addbutton=\"true\">\n9x22TylerSims.png|[[Do You Believe in Magic]]\n9x23TylerSims.png|[[Readiness is All]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Tyler Sims Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sims, Tyler}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
