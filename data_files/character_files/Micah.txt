Brian even waited three years to propose because of the conflict within their family.\n\n===Earthquake===\nIn an attempt to resolve the conflict within their family, Brian planned a ski trip for them. While they were riding the ski lift to the top of the hill, Brian with Micah and Karen with Danielle, the earthquake hit. Micah fell and Brian fell with him after trying to stop him. Brian had only minor injuries, but Micah broke his leg and had abdominal pain. Tests revealed that Brian's injuries required no further testing, but Micah was taken for a CT. The CT revealed a grade IV splenic laceration, so they planned surgery, but before he could be taken, he coded in the room. They were able to resuscitate him and get him to an OR, where they removed his spleen and repaired his other injuries.\n\nAfter surgery, Micah was stable.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nMicah has a single mom, Karen. Karen got engaged to Brian, whom Micah doesn't seem to like. Brian also has a daughter, Danielle, who thinks Micah's a dweeb.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 14 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He didn't want to go on the ski trip.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
