He told her to get in the front seat of his taxi so she would be more comfortable and drove her to the hospital. On the way, he started a video chat with the hospital because he was sure she was close to having the baby. When they were just a couple blocks away from the hospital, they were hit by another car. Steve said his head hurt, but otherwise, he was more worried about Mindy.\n\nIn the ER, Steve waited for a head CT. He also tried to keep tabs on Mindy and her progress. He said he wanted to see it through because he felt emotionally involved. While he waited, he was in a bed next to [[Garth Jones]]. He noticed that Garth was breathing oddly and called for a doctor to look at it.\n\nHe was discharged while Mindy's case was still unknown and he was disappointed by that. However, Ben informed him that Garth had a collapsed lung and Steve had saved his life.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe has at least two children. He was excited to go home and tell them he'd been a hero that day.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a taxi driver.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duncan, Steve}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
