Jo spent time running around the hospital, tracking down which nurse had tended to [[Frankie Baner]], so they'd know what kind of stroke he was having so they could treat him properly. She asked [[Nurse James|James]] and learned that Karen had been on shift at that time, but Karen said she was tied up, so she asked [[Nurse Taylor|Taylor]] to take care of Frankie. Jo found Taylor just as he was leaving the hospital and he told her that he hadn't given Frankie Vitamin K, meaning giving him heparin would probably kill him. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\n===Karin Taylor===\nWhen [[Karin Taylor]] complained of pain in the ER, Karen came to get April to tell her about it. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n===Tad===\nWhen [[Tad]] started coughing up blood in the ER, Karen stepped in to help and informed [[Tom Koracick]] that no labs had been ordered for Tad. ''(\"[[Gut Feeling]]\")''\n\n===Frankie's Death===\nWhen fellow nurse, [[Frankie Shavelson|Frankie]], was 28 weeks pregnant, she collapsed. Her spleen was twisted, but she refused surgery because she was worried about her baby. Her spleen started to un-twist, but then she had abdominal bleeding, so she was rushed into surgery. In surgery, the bleed was stopped, but then Frankie crashed, so they did an emergency c-section to deliver her son. After that, they tried to resuscitate her but they were unsuccessful. Richard then delivered the news of her death to Karen and the other nurses. ''(\"[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\")''\n\n===Catherine's Surgery===\nWhen Catherine had surgery to remove her tumor, Karen was in the crowd watching from the gallery. ''(\"[[The Winner Takes It All]]\")''\n\n===Lining the Hall for Abby===\nWhen [[Abby Redding]] needed surgery after being raped, Karen was among the women who lined the hallway to the elevator to ensure that Abby wouldn't see any men's faces. ''(\"[[Silent All These Years]]\")''\n\n===Directing Sabrina and Chris===\nWhen [[Sabrina Webber|Sabrina]] and [[Chris Webber]] came to the hospital looking for Richard, Karen told them she knew who he was, but he didn't work there anymore and they needed to go to [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]] instead. ''(\"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\")''\n\n===Leo's X-ray===\nWhen Leo had an x-ray after throwing up at day care, Karen came in to tell Teddy and Owen the scans were up. ''(\"[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]]\")''\n\n===Joey Phillips===\nWhen [[Joey Phillips]] refused to do his physical therapy, Cormac went to Karen and asked for the location of the video game cart, hoping that would help. She went to look for it. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\n===Richard's Surgery===\nKaren was among the medical staff in the gallery watching Richard's explantation and hip replacement. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n===Robert's Surgery===\nWhen [[Robert Sullivan]] had surgery to treat his nerve condition, Karen checked on him afterward. He was in extreme pain, so she gave him morphine as Amelia had ordered. ''(\"[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\")''\n\n===Covid-19===\nA month into the Covid-19 pandemic, Karen was working outside the hospital, screening patients before they were brought in or sent home. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nOn the new interns' first day, Karen became frustrated with [[James Chee]], who had spent two hours on progress notes and summaries and hadn't even finished one. When she saw Koracick approaching, she told him to fix it. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nWhen Seattle Pres closed to incoming patients due to being at capacity, Karen helped set up the cafeteria as COVID overflow. She informed Teddy that they had four more high-flows because they'd lost the patients who were using them. ''(\"[[No Time for Despair]]\")''\n\n===Car Accident===\nWhen [[Noah Young|Noah]] and [[Danny Young]] were brought to the ER after a car accident, Karen went to the ambulance bay with Owen to greet them. When Owen asked where his resident was, Karen said she wasn't their keeper. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nShe is a nurse at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]].\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x08NurseKaren.png|[[Out of Nowhere]]\n14x10NurseKaren.png|[[Personal Jesus]]\n15x03NurseKaren.png|[[Gut Feeling]]\n15x07NurseKaren.png|[[Anybody Have a Map?]]\n15x11NurseKaren.png|[[The Winner Takes It All]]\n15x19NurseKaren.png|[[Silent All These Years]]\n16x07NurseKaren.png|[[Papa Don't Preach]]\n16x11NurseKaren.png|[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]]\n16x14NurseKaren.png|[[A Diagnosis]]\n16x21NurseKaren.png|[[Put on a Happy Face]]\nS193x16NurseKaren.png|[[Louder Than a Bomb]]\n17x01NurseKaren.png|[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\n17x03NurseKaren.png|[[My Happy Ending]]\n17x06NurseKaren.png|[[No Time for Despair]] (left)\n18x02NurseKaren.png|[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x19-13.jpg\n15x19-14.jpg\n15x19-29.jpg\n15x19-30.jpg\n17x01-9.jpg\n17x01-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Nurse Karen Appearances}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Karen}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Nurses]]"}}}]}}}}
