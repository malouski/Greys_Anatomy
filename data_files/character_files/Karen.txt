While they were riding the ski lift, an earthquake hit and Micah fell off the ski lift. Brian fell after him when he tried to stop Micah from falling. They both fell about 14 feet and were taken to the ER. Brian had only minor injuries and after repeat labs were clear, he was told he would be discharged soon. Meanwhile, Micah had a broken leg and some abdominal injuries. They took him for a CT, where they diagnosed a grade IV splenic laceration and had to resuscitate him when he coded immediately after the CT. They went back out to the ER where they waited for Karen to re-appear before telling her that Micah needed surgery.

After surgery, Karen was told that Micah would be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nKaren dated Brian for three years before becoming engaged.
