In CT, Mia was scared and wanted Anna, whom her mother had dismissed in the ER. Her mother tried singing her the goodnight song to get her to stay still for the CT, but Mia said she was singing it wrong and that she wanted Anna.\n\nThey took Mia into surgery where they repaired the damage. After her surgery, she was stable and they said she'd be taken for an MRI for her skull fracture, but hopefully wouldn't need any more surgery. The MRI showed bleeding in Mia's brain, so Derek said she needed to have brain surgery.\n\nMia had her second surgery and was awake and stable afterward. She continued to asked for Anna and her mother eventually relented and went to get Anna from the waiting room. Reunited, Anna and Mia sang the good night song together.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nMia's parents, while they love her, are not heavily involved in her day-to-day life, leaving the majority of the child care to their nanny, [[Anna]].\n\n===Professional===\nMia is very close to her nanny, Anna. They have a special good night song that they sing together. When Mia was in the hospital, she repeatedly asked for Anna to comfort her.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was five at the time of her hospitalization.\n*Her blood type is A-.\n*She's allergic to penicillin and wheat.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hanson, Mia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
