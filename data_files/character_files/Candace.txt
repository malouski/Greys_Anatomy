Nathan checked on her and told her her wrist was broken. She got into the medical kit, but there was no brace, so he had to reset her wrist and then wrap it until they could land and get proper medical care.\n\nCandace helped them treat the other patients while they waited for clearance to land somewhere. Once they'd landed, she was told to follow-up with her regular doctor about her wrist.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nAfter they landed, she flirted with Nathan, asking if she should call him for a follow-up, but Nathan brushed her off.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a flight attendant. Her route services Seattle.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
