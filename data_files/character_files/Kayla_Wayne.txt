This resulted in Kayla being actually cut nearly in half. She was rushed to the ER where her abdominal wounds were evaluated. She was taken directly from there into surgery.\n\nIn surgery, her kidney and part of her large intestine had to be removed. They reached a point where continuing to operate would kill her, so they packed her and took her to the ICU.\n\nWhile in the ICU, Kayla developed abdominal compartment syndrome and was taken back into surgery. They were able to relieve the pressure in her abdomen and bring her back to the ICU. They told [[Danny Wayne]] and [[Cherise]] that the next 24 hours would be critical.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Danny Wayne]]====\nShe is married to Danny Wayne, a magician. She works as his assistant. However, she is in love with Danny's other assistant, [[Cherise]]. When Danny learned about this, he told Cherise that he thought that if he just got a little bit more famous, Kayla would love him again, but now he knows that that's not true, so he left.\n\n====[[Cherise]]====\nAt some point while married to Danny, she fell in love with Cherise, who was also her husband's assistant.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a magician's assistant.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 32 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wayne, Kayla}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
