He believed himself to be extremely unlucky. While he was being moved in the hospital, the wheelchair locked up, so he decided just to walk. However, the floor was wet due to the roof leaking and he slipped and hit his head. They took him for a CT. While he was in CT, the roof in there started leaking and the machine shorted out.\n\nHe thought he might not have surgery, but he ultimately agreed. In surgery, the ceiling caved in. He had to be covered and moved to another OR to finish his surgery. Because they were concerned about water and debris from the ceiling, they opened his incision wider and did a more thorough examination of his abdomen. While they were doing that, they found a tumor on his pancreas, so they removed it and sent it to pathology.\n\nJack thought that was yet another example of his bad luck, but Alex told him that the tumor was only stage one. They never find pancreatic tumors that early. The roof caving in probably saved his life. His luck had turned.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married until his wife left him.\n\nThere's a girl at the grocery store he wanted to say hi to, but he couldn't, so he just kept asking her about the produce.\n\n==Career==\nThe store he worked at burned down.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 47 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*His cat ran away.\n*His TV only shows the color green.\n*His accountant stole from him.\n*He's been in three car accidents in the last year.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:O'Brien, Jack}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
