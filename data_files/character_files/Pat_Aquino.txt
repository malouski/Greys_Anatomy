When [[Will]], a fairgoer who was high on mushrooms, stole station 19's engine and caused it to be tipped on its side, blocking an intersection, Pat sent two of his firefighters, Theo and Andy, to help them free Will. Later, when the engine caught fire, he and his team worked to put it out. He also consoled Andy, as he knew the engine was important to her, as it was dedicated in memory of her father. ''(\"[[Phoenix from the Flame]]\")''\n\n===Structure Fire===\nPat led his team to a house with a fire in the basement when they were called to back up station 23. When they arrived, they learned they were going to do a surrounded and drown to prevent anyone else from entering the house, as five firefighters had already passed out after going inside. ''(\"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\")''\n\n===Heat Wave===\nOn the day station 19 received their new engine, Aquino approved Andy and Theo going there to participate in the push-in. Later, he oversaw a call where 23 and 19 responded to a multi-car accident. He called Andy to go take a break and cool off and then called her back in a few minutes later. ''(\"[[Too Darn Hot]]\")''\n\n===Conflict Resolution Training===\nIn order to expand Crisis One to the entire SFD, Dean arranged for Diane to train them all in conflict resolution and how to deal with a variety of scenarios they might see. For the first scenario, she asked Andy and Sullivan to play a married couple with a domestic dispute. She was unaware they were separated. She played the responder in the scenario. When Sullivan had to leave to respond to a call, Theo took his place and the scenario continued. Vic swapped in as the responder, but this ended with her and Theo flirting. Dean suggested he pick the pairings to avoid interpersonal relationships, which Diane agreed to. Next, he had Jack and Maddox play co-workers, the latter of whom had locked himself in the conference room. Dean played the responder. When Maddox got very hammy, Dean accused him of not taking it seriously, so Diane called for them to take a break. For another scenario, Aquino was having a crisis and Ben played the responder and was able to talk him through it. They continued their training and at the end of the day, Diane felt they were prepared to work with the program. ''(\"[[100% or Nothing]]\")''\n\n===Gas Main Explosion===\nA gas main exploded about half a mile from station 19. After some time at the scene, station 19 called for backup and station 23 was sent to help them. After [[Fire Chief McCallister]] joined the scene, command of the scene was shifted to him and Aquino and Beckett began assisting with evacuations. While checking a house, Aquino was blown back when he opened the door to a house full of gas, as Beckett had been unable to warn him in time. He had a penetrating wound to his abdomen, but he was conscious after the explosion. He was loaded onto a gurney and into an aid car. ''(\"[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station 19)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, he was taken to surgery after x-rays revealed an open-book pelvic fracture along with the penetrating abdominal wound and facial burns. After surgery, Link said he'd need a few months of physical therapy, but he'd be okay. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romance===\nHe is married. ''(\"[[Phoenix from the Flame]]\")''\n\n===Friendships===\nHe has a friendly rivalry with [[Sean Beckett|Captain Sean Beckett]]. ''(\"[[100% or Nothing]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nHe is the fire captain of [[SFD Station 23]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He wears a black wedding ring.<ref>[[Phoenix from the Flame]], 5x01 (S19)</ref>\n*He loses to [[Sean Beckett]] at Football Squares every year.<ref name=\"100% or Nothing\" />\n*He is Filipino.<ref>[[Things We Lost in the Fire (Station 19)|Things We Lost in the Fire]], 5x05 (S19)</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS195x04-6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Pat Aquino Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aquino, Pat}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Firefighters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
