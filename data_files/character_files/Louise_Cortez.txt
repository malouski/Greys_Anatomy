Webber had inserted a drain to release the fluid and Bailey sent Jackson to monitor her. While Jackson was doing a check, she was delirious, so Bailey told him to take her into an OR and open her up to get her ready for Bailey. However, by the time Bailey arrived, Jackson was calling time of death.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was pronounced dead at 7:41.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cortez, Louise}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
