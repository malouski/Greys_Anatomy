He was scheduled for a DOR procedure, but before he could have it, a heart became available. He initially refused the heart transplant, fearing that his new heart wouldn't love his boyfriend, [[Henry (Old Scars, Future Hearts)|Henry]], like his old one, but was eventually persuaded to accept it when Henry broke up with him. During his transplant, they discovered that the heart was too large for his chest cavity due to edema. They transplanted the heart anyway and used plastic to wrap his chest cavity while they waited for the swelling to go down so they could close his chest. He was moved to the ICU for observation and Henry came back and regretted having said what he did because he only broke up with Charlie to get him to agree to the surgery.\n\nThey operated the next day and were able to close his chest. Charlie woke up and he and Henry reunited.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe and his boyfriend, [[Henry (Old Scars, Future Hearts)|Henry]], like to cosplay knights together.\n\n===Familial===\nHis mother was supportive of his knight cosplay, but didn't play along. When he tried to refuse the heart transplant, she said she'd sign consent for them to sedate him for it anyway.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He referred to his ECMO machine as a dragon.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peterson, Charlie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
