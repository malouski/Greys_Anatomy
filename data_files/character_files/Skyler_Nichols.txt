She was taken to the hospital, where they suspected a brain bleed due to depressed skull fracture. Amelia took her for a CT, which confirmed the bleed, so Amelia did a craniectomy so they could wait for the swelling to go down. Once the swelling went down, they replaced the removed portion of her skull, but two days later, she was still not awake despite no obvious reason on her scans. They had to place a tracheostomy to maintain an airway for her. Her EEG showed her brain function decreasing, but Amelia noticed a spike in activity when music was played. Amelia realized she could possibly respond to commands while in the MRI. She set up a system where Skyler thought of music when her answer to a question was yes and her childhood bedroom when the answer was no. After establishing this, Amelia had them bring in Skyler's father, so he was able to communicate with her using this system. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nMonths later at an AA meeting, Amelia shared with the group that Skyler had made a miraculous recovery and walked out of the hospital. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer father wasn't around a lot growing up because he worked so much. During the pandemic, she moved back in with him and they started getting to know each other better.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 25 at the time of her accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nichols, Skyler}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
