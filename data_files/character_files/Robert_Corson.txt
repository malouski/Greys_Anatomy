When they arrived at the meeting place, the influencer they believed they were meeting wasn't there. Instead, Bob grabbed them and threw them into a van. He threw their phones into the ocean and then took them back to a house, where he locked them in a room in the basement, though it's not clear what the plan was from there.\n\nWhen Joyce, Jada's mother, discovered the girls missing in the morning, she tracked Jada's phone down by the water, but then the signal died. She then tracked Jada's fitness watch to Bob's house. She knocked on his door, but he slammed the door in her face. When she called for help, she attacked some off-duty firefighters, who then helped her. Bob called the police, claiming there were trespassers on his lawn. [[Officer Wicklund|Officers Wicklund]] and [[Officer Schneider|Schneider]] responded to his call, thought police had ignored Joyce's reports and calls. Bob denied any wrongdoing and asked to have the other people removed. However, this did not happen as a window in the basement shattered due to a fire. Bob exited the house coughing and firefighters went in in search of the two girls. When the girls were pulled out, Bob was arrested, though he continued to deny any wrongdoing and claimed the girls had broken into his house and started a fire. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\nBob was later taken to the hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation and the burns on his arm. He continued to maintain his innocence as he was treated. In the ER, he had an ischemic stroke and had to have a CT Angio to treat it. ''(\"[[No Time for Despair]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nHe works alongside fellow human trafficker [[Opal]]. When he ended up at the hospital, she watched him from a distance to ensure he didn't tell the cops anything.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nS194x05BobCorson.png|[[Out of Control]]\n17x06BobCorson.png|[[No Time for Despair]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS194x05-14.jpg\nS194x05-17.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Bob Corson Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corson, Robert}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}}}]}}}}
