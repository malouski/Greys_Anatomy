At the hospital, he insisted that it was probably just because of his hernia, but they said his hernia didn't seem to be the cause of the obstruction. Once his daughter was out of the room, he told them he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. He'd had five polyps removed in the last three years and radiation. He hadn't told Beth and didn't want to tell her. They ran a CT and got his medical records sent over. He started coughing up blood and had to be rushed into surgery. In surgery, they found a tumor, meaning he'd need more aggressive treatment. After his surgery, Beth was told he'd be awake in a few hours and despite Michael's insistence that she might be told, Owen told her the the had colorectal cancer.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married until his wife died when his daughter was young.\n\n===Familial===\nAfter his wife died, he spoiled his daughter, Beth, believing that losing her mother so young was enough pain for a lifetime. When he was diagnosed with cancer, he hid that information from her.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Whitman, Michael}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
