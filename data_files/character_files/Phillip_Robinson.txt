Phillip then drove the three of them the hospital.\n\nThe baby bear cub had bitten right through Phillip's hand. He was taken for x-rays. He needed surgery, but Callie said that he needed 24 hours of antibiotics before the surgery, so they irrigated it and splinted it.\n\nWhile he was filling out his paperwork, Meredith noticed him squinting and saw that his handwriting was completely illegible. He also showed signs of impulsive behavior, so Meredith suspected that he had a brain tumor. She ordered an MRI, which showed an inoperable malignant glioma. ''(\"[[Where the Wild Things Are]]\")''\n\nMeredith did some research and found an idea for a clinical trial for inoperable gliomas. It involved injecting live virus into the tumor to shrink it.\n\nPhillip's tumor had progressed to the point where he had inappropriate affect much of the time, altering between laughing and yelling. He'd also started to lose his vision. During an exam he lost the bit of his vision that was left. They decided to move the surgery up because the tumor had invaded the optic nerve.\n\nThey took him into surgery where\u00a0they injected the virus, but it went into the wrong place and Phillip died. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to [[Jennifer Robinson]]. They'd only known each other ten days when they got married.\n\nAs his tumor grew, Phillip started to pick out a new husband for Jennifer. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n===Familial===\nHe was upset at having caused his brother to get mauled by a bear. Because of his tumor, when he heard that his brother had died, he laughed.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was pronounced dead at 19:33.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n412PhillipRobinson.png|[[Where the Wild Things Are]]\n413PhillipRobinson.png|[[Piece of My Heart]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x13-29.jpg\n4x13-30.jpg\n4x13-31.jpg\n4x13-34.jpg\n4x13-38.jpg\n4x13-40.jpg\n4x13-41.jpg\n4x13-42.jpg\n4x13-46.jpg\n4x13-50.jpg\n4x13-56.jpg\n4x13-59.jpg\n4x13-60.jpg\n4x13-61.jpg\n4x13-62.jpg\n4x13-81.jpg\n4x13-82.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Phillip Robinson Appearances}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robinson, Phillip}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
