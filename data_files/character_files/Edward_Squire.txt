He was taken to the ER. In the ER, he was assessed and was asked to list all the medications he was on. [[Jackson Avery]] explicitly asked him if he was taking anything for erectile dysfunction, knowing that many patients won't be forthcoming about that information. Eddie said he didn't use them and attempted to stimulate an erection in the ER to prove it, thought the doctors quickly stopped him.\n\nHe later said he had chest pain, so [[Isaac Cross]] gave him nitroglycerin. However, this caused him to code, likely because he'd been lying about use of drugs to treat erectile dysfunction. They were unable to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead in the ER.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhen his son learned of his death, he was devastated.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He only responded to Eddie.\n*He was pronounced dead at 12:19.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Squire, Edward}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]"}}}]}}}}
