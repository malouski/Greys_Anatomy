They were getting worse, so he came to the ER. They ran a CT and found an adrenal mass. Then [[Reed Adamson]] noticed neurological symptoms and diagnosed carotid stenosis, so his tumor resection was delayed so they could treat that. Before his surgery, he developed expressive aphasia. An MRI showed a subdural hematoma, so he needed to have that treated first.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis daughter, [[Leslie Goldman|Leslie]], came to the hospital with him. When [[Reed Adamson]] and [[Alex Karev]] started fighting over his care, she yelled at them for not concentrating on her father.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He'd fallen a few months prior and sustained a stable hip fracture.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goldman, Michael}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
