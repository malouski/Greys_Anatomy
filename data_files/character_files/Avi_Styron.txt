She'd had three before and all required surgery. Dahlia ordered a CT to check for a bowel obstruction, but because Avi had had her period the previous day and was sure it was an obstruction like before, she didn't wait for the labs to come back. During the CT, Meredith was shocked to see that Avi was not only pregnant, but she was giving birth. Meredith went into the room with Avi and delivered her baby. Bailey also noticed that Avi had two uteruses which is why she continued to have a period through her pregnancy. After giving birth, Avi was moved to a room where she bonded with her son.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x22-19.jpg\n15x22-21.jpg\n15x22-22.jpg\n15x22-23.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Styron, Avi}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
