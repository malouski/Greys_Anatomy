Amelia and Meredith were both familiar with their work. They met Meredith and Amelia when they came to Minnesota to hear David Hamilton's pitch for them to work together to cure Parkinson's Disease. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nKai continued to work with Amelia after Amelia returned to Seattle, using video calls to share research. Kai then asked if Amelia could return to Minnesota soon to help them work out some kinks. Amelia said she would. Kai then helped Amelia get some relief from the heat by having her imagine being somewhere very cold. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\nTheir research continued when Amelia and Meredith returned to Minnesota, along with newly-recruited Tom Koracick. In order to get approval for the next step, they first had to prove to the FDA that the cells would survive, so they began running trials to figure out a way to keep the cells from dying with the help of some gel brains provided by Tom. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Amelia Shepherd]]====\nKai and Amelia began flirting with each other shortly after their first meeting. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\nFinally, one night, they each attempted to be the last person out of the lab. Kai said they were typically the last one to leave, but agreed to leave first so Amelia could win some points with Hamilton. Before they left, Kai asked about Amelia's family, whom Tom had mentioned. Amelia told Kai about her son and his dad, but then said she was single. Kai said they were also single.
