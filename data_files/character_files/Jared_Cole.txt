He was in the hospital to have a biliary diversion which would allow the bile to drain out of his abdomen.\n\nThe initial plan was to use part of his intestine to make the stoma, but [[Alex Karev]] had the idea to use his appendix instead, removing the need to cut into his healthy intestine. The surgery was successful and after surgery, Jared's skin was a more normal color.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\n====[[Kim Cole]]====\nJared is the son of [[Kim Cole]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Upon seeing her prosthetic leg, Jared asked [[Arizona Robbins]] if she's a robot.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x15-1.jpg\n10x15-2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cole, Jared}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
