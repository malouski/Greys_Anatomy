Her pediatrician told her parents it was a mild case and would resolve on its own, but by the time she was three, it hadn't and she had an abnormally-shaped skull. Tom found her case and offered the parents a pro bono surgery in exchange for being allowed to film the surgery and their family before and after. Having no other way to afford the surgery, they agreed, though it made them visibly uncomfortable.\n\nNoticing their discomfort and wanting to ease it, Jackson went to the parents and gave them the option to decline the cameras access, promising that they wouldn't have to pay for Clervie's surgery either way. They chose to proceed without the cameras. Clervie's surgery went well and her parents sat by her bed in the PICU afterward.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Dana Martin]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe and Dana have one daughter, Clervie.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martin, Peter}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
