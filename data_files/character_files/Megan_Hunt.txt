She served in the U.S. Army as a [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]] at the same time as her brother,\u00a0[[Teddy Altman]], and\u00a0[[Nathan Riggs]]. She was formerly engaged to Nathan and she is raising her son, [[Farouk Shami Hunt]].\n\n==History==\n===Early Life===\nMegan is three years younger than her brother Owen and grew up in Seattle with her family. The siblings attended medical school together, where they met Nathan Riggs, with whom she became romantically involved.\n\nOne summer, Megan and Owen went on a family road trip in California but Megan left the map in a rest-stop bathroom. Their father was furious and he refused to pull over and ask for directions. After hours of arguing with Evelyn and the kids complaining, their father just pulled over at a beach and they played there for hours until the sun went down. She considers it one of the best experiences of her childhood. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n===Disappearance===\nIn 2007 on the day of Megan's disappearance, a nervous Megan mocked Owen's difficult relationship with Beth while she, Teddy, and Owen were waiting to leave their base to fly to Fallujah. Their Colonel would announce the stratification rankings there, which could help Megan make the promotion to flight surgeon that she had been after. Megan went to get Nathan, who had been on call the night before. As she dragged Nathan out of bed, she found a necklace. He told her she wasn't supposed to find that yet and said it wasn't exactly a ring as she had lost a ring in the sink before. As he began proposing, she eagerly said yes. The two then joined Owen and Teddy to board the chopper, where Megan shared the news and showed off her engagement necklace.\n\nAt the Mobile Medical Treatment Center in Fallujah, Megan overheard other soldiers naming her number one for the strat ranking. However, the Colonel named John Matthews number one. Megan's disappointment was cut short when they had to spring into action to save wounded soldiers that had been shot by two of their Iraqi allies. As she and Owen were triaging, Megan vented her disappointment and asked if Owen had told the Colonel that she was CGO of the year. He told her he had but said those decisions were always political. Megan then went to take care of an Iraqi woman that did not want to be touched by men. The MP pointed out the woman had tried to wrestle the gun out of one of the shooters' hands. Megan learned her name was Sana and convinced her to let her examine her. After she placed a chest tube, Owen asked Megan to scrub in with him so they could celebrate her engagement, which meant their mother would have to plan two weddings.\n\nDuring their surgery, Megan wasn't shy about telling Owen to ditch Beth. Owen then brought up he was going to miss working with her if she had gotten the flight surgeon job, which he mentioned was three times more dangerous than her current job. Upon hearing him say that, she strongly suspected he hadn't recommended her but he dodged the question, only stating it wasn't his decision. They disagreed over their approach so Owen pulled rank, but Megan defied him and did it her way, which he had deemed too risky. She forced him into helping her, which led to them saving their patient's arm. Upset at him tanking her chance at her dream job, she decided not to fly back with Owen to the Green Zone and stayed behind with Teddy.\n\nAs she was relaxing on the OR table, Nathan found her and asked for the necklace back. Megan thought he had found out that she had slept with someone on a drunk night, but he actually came to get it back because it wasn't his to give. She then realized he had proposed to her with another girl's necklace. She got mad at him, though he pointed out she had just given him reason to be mad, too. She inquired if he had been serious about proposing, which he was. As he asked her if she had been serious about accepting the proposal, a soldier interrupted their talk to inform Megan that Sana wasn't doing well. Megan repositioned her chest tube while talking about her brother controlling her life to keep Sana calm. Megan then made sure Sana would be flown out on the next chopper.\n\nNot wanting to stay with Nathan at the medical center, she boarded the chopper with Sana. As the chopper was taking off, Teddy found out that Sana was actually the second shooter and that the man whom they had believed to be the second shooter had actually been wrestling the gun from her hands, not the other way around. Teddy tried to stop the chopper from taking off but she was too late. As a distracted and pensive Megan was staring out the window, Sana managed to grab her gun and hijack the helicopter, which disappeared while flying through unprotected airspace. Megan then disappeared for ten years. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\nHer disappearance caused a rift between Owen and Nathan, both of whom told people their own version of the story of her disappearance.\n\nOriginally, Nathan told Meredith that he had been working in a field unit with Megan on that day. According to him, they needed to transport a patient, but the chopper only had room for one of them. Megan wanted to go, as the patient was hers, so after failing to talk her out of it, Nathan agreed to let her on board. The chopper, however, never made it. Nathan also pointed out that after Megan's disappearance, he would've continued to look for her, but Owen wanted to give up searching and made him stop.\n\nUpon hearing Nathan's story from Meredith, Owen laughed joylessly, claiming that Nathan never said anything to Megan about not getting on board and, in fact, wasn't even anywhere near the chopper on that day, but with another woman. According to him, Megan had called him earlier that day, telling him that Nathan had been repeatedly cheating on her and that she was getting on the chopper to get away from him. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n\nNathan later admitted to Maggie that, although he had told mostly the truth, he did cheat on her and they did fight. He said that he didn't tell Meredith about the fighting and cheating because he believed some things were meant for just him and Megan, and that he didn't owe anyone that explanation. ''(\"[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]\")''\n\nOwen later admitted to Amelia that when he learned that Nathan had cheated on Megan, he had told her to get on the helicopter. It was the last thing he ever said to her. ''(\"[[Trigger Happy]]\")''\n\n===Being Found===\nTen years after she went missing, she was found in the basement of a house in a rebel-held neighborhood, where she'd been left after a raid. After a hospital stay in Germany, she was sent to Seattle. ''(\"[[True Colors (Grey's Anatomy)|True Colors]]\")''\n[[File:13x24MeganHunt.png|thumb|200px|Megan arrives at Madigan.]]\nSince a fire made the helipad at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] unavailable the day of her arrival, Owen and Amelia drove to Madigan Army Medical Center to meet the helicopter she was in. They were warned that she might communicate in extremes or possibly not at all. When Nathan learned that she was alive, he also left to go to Madigan. ''(\"[[Ring of Fire]]\")''\n\n===Abdominal Closure===\nOnce she was at the hospital, Megan revealed that despite being held captive, she was treated well. They only threw her in the basement to protect her from a bombing and wasn't actually kept in there. The only complaint she had was that she had a massive abdominal wound from a bombing that hadn't closed, which left her with a frozen abdomen. She was desperate to get back to her son, Farouk, a Syrian refugee she'd been caring for since he was four, so she wanted to get her abdomen repaired as quickly as possible so she could return to Iraq to be with him. Meredith suggested an extreme surgery that would close her abdomen much sooner than the more conservative approach and Megan jumped at the more radical option. After using saline implants to stretch her skin, Meredith attempted surgery to close her repaired abdomen, but found that she didn't have enough skin to close. ''(\"[[Break Down the House]]\")''\n\nMeredith was forced to come up with an alternative plan to close her abdomen. After considering her options, she decided to look for a donor to give Megan an abdominal wall transplant. She challenged the sub-interns to find her a suitable donor. After reviewing several candidates they proposed, she finally found a good donor. Megan agreed to the transplant and it went well. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\nA week after surgery, she had sensation in her new skin and was healing well. ''(\"[[Go Big or Go Home]]\")''\n\n===Infection===\nTo her dismay, she developed an infection in her abdomen which required IV antibiotics. When she learned that Farouk was in the hospital, she tried to leave so she could go back to him, but Meredith stopped her and convinced her to stay, reminding her that she couldn't be there for Farouk if she died. Unbeknownst to her, Farouk was only in the hospital as a cover Nathan was using to get him a medical visa to come to the US. She was happy to be reunited with Farouk. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n===Move to Los Angeles===\nAfter being released from the hospital, Megan decided to move to Los Angeles with Farouk and Nathan, because when she was in Iraq, she consoled herself with remembering a childhood trip to the beach and the only part of the trip she couldn't fake was the ocean, which made her determined to visit the ocean every day once she was rescued. She sent Farouk and Nathan ahead to get the [[Megan and Nathan's House|house]] ready and then took a road trip to join them. Owen unexpectedly joined her on the trip, which gave them time to hash out their old issues. Once she arrived in Los Angeles, she walked out onto the beach and into the water. Nathan and Farouk quickly joined her and they played in the water together happily. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\n===Caleb Hicks===\n[[Caleb Hicks]] was a patient of Megan's in San Diego. He had lost a leg, penis, and scrotum in an IED explosion and also had a frozen abdomen like she had. She convinced him to go for the abdominal wall transplant by showing him her own result. He was then brought to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to have that transplant as well as a penis and scrotum. After being briefly cancelled, the surgery was rescheduled and went forward as planned. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\n===Teddy and Owen's Wedding===\nMegan and Farouk came to Seattle for Teddy and Owen's wedding. The wedding was initially supposed to take place in a park, but before the priest could finish the ceremony, a couple on a tandem bicycle crashed into him, seriously injuring both him and the couple. After the priest died, Megan stepped in and performed the ceremony at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nAfter the wedding, Megan stayed in Seattle to help cover Meredith's cases while she was in Minnesota. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n===Farouk's Illness===\nMegan became concerned when Farouk started getting winded more than normal and had swollen ankles. She took him to the hospital so Cormac could examine him and was upset to learn that he had contrastive pericarditis. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Nathan Riggs]]====\nMegan and Nathan were in a romantic relationship, and Megan apparently loved him dearly. However, according to Owen, Nathan had been cheating on her, prompting her to get on the chopper along with which she disappeared. ''(\"[[I Wear the Face]]\")''\n[[File:12x07-8.jpg|thumb|Owen and Nathan have a confrontation over Megan.]]\n\nDuring their time together, she and Nathan talked about having kids. ''(\"[[Both Sides Now]]\")''\n\nAfter she was rescued, Nathan proposed to Megan, but she turned him down because she believed he was still in love with Meredith. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\nHowever, she later accepted the proposal and they moved to Los Angeles together with Farouk. ''(\"[[Danger Zone]]\")''\n\nMegan said that she and Nathan visit a couple's therapist weekly. ''(\"[[The Whole Package]]\")''\n\nOn Owen and Teddy's wedding day, Megan revealed that she and Nathan had split up. She stated it was a \"pandemic casualty.\" ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n===Familial===\n====[[Owen Hunt]]====\nWhile she was missing, Owen did not talk about Megan to his friends and co-workers. After some of them found out about her existence, he\u00a0revealed that they were very close and she used to follow Owen and do everything he did. He described her as being smarter, funnier, and a better person than him.\n\nAfter returning to Seattle and meeting Amelia, Megan talked with Teddy and Evelyn and they all agreed that Owen and Amelia's marriage was not a good one. ''(\"[[Get Off on the Pain]]\")''\n\n====[[Farouk Shami Hunt]]====\nWhile she was being held captive in Iraq, she took custody of a child named Farouk, a Syrian refugee whose parents had died in combat. Because she hadn't legally adopted him, she wasn't able to bring him to the United States with her. She'd been taking care of him for six years at the time of her rescue.\n\n==Career==\nMegan graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]]. She later joined the US Army as a staff [[Surgery|surgeon]].\n\nShe currently works as a [[Trauma Surgery|trauma surgeon]] in Los Angeles, possibly with a focus on veterans. She holds privileges at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], which she obtained when participating on an abdominal wall and penis and scrotum transplant. After Owen and Teddy's wedding, she stuck around at Grey Sloan to cover the post-pandemic physician shortage at Grey Sloan.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She liked the name Bernard for a child.<ref>[[Both Sides Now]], 13x05</ref>\n*She used to sing opera badly at the top of her lungs solely to mess with Owen because she knew he hated it.\n*She was 36 years old at the time of her abdominal wall transplant.<ref>[[Get Off on the Pain]], 14x02</ref>\n*She speaks Arabic.<ref>[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]], 14x04</ref>\n*She lost her class ring in a surgical sink.<ref>[[Danger Zone]], 14x05</ref>\n*She was portrayed by an unknown stand-in in\u00a0[[Ring of Fire]].\n*She sees a talk therapist, a somatic PTSD specialist, and a couples therapist (with Nathan) weekly.<ref>[[The Whole Package]], 15x20</ref>\n*She hasn't been to church in 20 years.<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], 18x01</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x08MeganHunt.png|[[The Room Where It Happens]]\n13x24MeganHunt.png|[[Ring of Fire]]\n14x01MeganHunt.png|[[Break Down the House]]\n14x02MeganHunt.png|[[Get Off on the Pain]]\n14x03MeganHunt.png|[[Go Big or Go Home]]\n14x04MeganHunt.png|[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\n14x05MeganHunt.png|[[Danger Zone]]\n15x20MeganHunt.png|[[The Whole Package]]\n18x01MeganHunt.png|[[Here Comes the Sun]]\n18x04MeganHunt.png|[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x08-28.jpg\n13x08-27.jpg\n13x08-26.jpg\n13x08-25.jpg\n13x08-24.jpg\n13x08-23.jpg\n13x08-22.jpg\n13x08-21.jpg\n13x08-20.jpg\n13x08-19.jpg\n13x08-18.jpg\n13x08-17.jpg\n13x08-16.jpg\n13x08-15.jpg\n13x08-14.jpg\n13x08-13.jpg\n13x08-12.jpg\n14x01-19.jpg\n14x01-21.jpg\n14x01-20.jpg\n14x01-18.jpg\n14x01-17.jpg\n14x01-14.jpg\n14x01-13.jpg\n14x01-12.jpg\n14x01-11.jpg\n14x01-10.jpg\n14x05-1.jpg\n14x05-7.jpg\n14x05-8.jpg\n14x05-10.jpg\n14x05-13.jpg\n14x05-19.jpg\n14x05-20.jpg\n14x05-21.jpg\n14x05-26.jpg\n14x05-29.jpg\n14x05-30.jpg\n14x05-31.jpg\n14x05-38.jpg\n14x05-39.jpg\n14x05-40.jpg\n14x05-41.jpg\n14x05-42.jpg\n14x05-43.jpg\n14x05-44.jpg\n14x05-45.jpg\n14x05-46.jpg\n15x20-1.jpg\n15x20-18.jpg\n15x20-19.jpg\n15x20-20.jpg\n15x20-21.jpg\n15x20-22.jpg\n15x20-23.jpg\n15x20-24.jpg\n15x20-25.jpg\n15x20-26.jpg\n15x20-27.jpg\n15x20-28.jpg\n15x20-29.jpg\n15x20-30.jpg\n15x20-31.jpg\n15x20-32.jpg\n15x20-33.jpg\n15x20-34.jpg\n15x20-35.jpg\n15x20-36.jpg\n18x01-7.jpg\n18x01-8.jpg\n18x05-24.jpg\n18x05-25.jpg\n18x05-26.jpg\n18x05-27.jpg\n18x05-28.jpg\n18x05-29.jpg\n18x05-30.jpg\n18x05-31.jpg\n18x05-32.jpg\n18x06-1.jpg\n18x06-2.jpg\n18x06-3.jpg\n18x06-5.jpg\n18x06-10.jpg\n18x06-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Megan Hunt Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[fr:Megan Hunt]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hunt, Megan}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]"}}}]}}}}
