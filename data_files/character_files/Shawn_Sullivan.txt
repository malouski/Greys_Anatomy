He was ready to be discharged, but Bailey had him promise not to smoke, drink, or eat fried food anymore. His wife went to fill out paperwork for his discharge.\n\nWanting to keep his promise, Shawn decided to smoke his last cigarette in the hospital. Because he was on oxygen, lighting the cigarette caused a small fire. Shawn was seriously burned all over his face and he hit hit head, causing a small hematoma. [[Mark Sloan]] examined him and then told [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] to stabilize him and get him a CT.\n\nShawn was worried about his face, so Mark said he'd remove the dead tissue and place live cells that would hopefully take root and heal his face. However, he was warned that his face wouldn't be like before. Mark called for a neuro consult and Derek suggested a night of observation before Mark treated his burns, but Mark decided to go ahead with it anyway.\n\nThe surgery went well. Mark removed the dead tissue and applied the live cells. They were told that if the cells took within 3-4 weeks, he'd heal well. His wife was upset to hear that his face might not ever be the same as before. Bailey then told him he had people in his life who loved him and that's what matters.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Mrs. Sullivan]].\n\n==Career==\nHe's a car salesman. He's said to be very good at his job.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 62 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sullivan, Shawn}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
