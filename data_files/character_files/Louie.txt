He realized after he slammed the door that the storm was serious, but he didn't want to lose the momentum of the slam, so he went for a walk. During his walk, the wind storm picked up, stirring up a large candy cane, which impaled him through his chest. He was taken to the hospital, where they diagnosed a pneumothorax, but no other obvious injuries. He was taken to surgery, where they cut the top off the candy cane and pulled it through. They were prepared for extensive bleeding and were shocked when they saw the candy cane had not caused any damage to his internal organs aside from a small hole in his diaphragm. His was was told he'd need to rest for a few weeks, but would be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Veronica]].
