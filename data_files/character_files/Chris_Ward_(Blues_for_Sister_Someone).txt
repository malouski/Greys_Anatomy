Once Chris and the kids were out of the room, Rose asked Addison to tie her tubes while she was in there doing the c-section. She'd been saving up so that she could pay for it because if they billed insurance, her husband would see it and he's a devout Catholic, so she couldn't let him know. She said that she believed God would understand, but her husband wouldn't.\n\nAddison agreed to do the surgery and after delivering the baby, she pretended she saw bleeding that necessitated tubal ligation. Addison told her after the surgery that she wouldn't be able to have any more babies. She then told her husband, because she wanted him to know Joseph would be their last baby. Chris then went to Alex and asked him about the alleged complication, which led to Alex telling him to get a lawyer.\n\nAddison went to Rose, trying to get her to tell Chris what had happened, but Rose said she wouldn't, saying it was her whole marriage and Addison's malpractice insurance would pay out the claim.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Rose Ward]]. Together, they have seven children. Chris loves Rose and they have a good relationship, but because of Chris's strict religious beliefs, Rose had her tubes tied secretly when she had a c-section. She only told Chris there was a problem in surgery that made her infertile because she wanted him to know that Joseph would be their last baby.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have seven children.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He is devoutly Catholic.\n*When he and his wife were first married, she went on the pill because they were so broke and he stopped taking communion during that time.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Chris Ward}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ward, Chris}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
