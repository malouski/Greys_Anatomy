Three weeks into her pregnancy, he moved in with his mistress. When Julie found out, she invited the woman out to have lunch with her in order to put a face to the woman who got her husband to throw away 15 years of marriage. When she was hospitalized being informed about the procedure she was about to undergo, she picked up on the fact that Meredith had slept with Addison's husband and began to speak disparagingly to her. When Julie asked to have Meredith removed from her case, Addison confronted her, saying that she had her information wrong and that Meredith was actually the wronged woman in their situation and prompted her to apologize.\n\n===Fetal Surgery===\nWhile she was pregnant, Julie was diagnosed with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which was endangering their lives. She came to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] because [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison]] was one of the few surgeons in the country who could separate the blood vessels and save both babies.\n\nWhen the babies started to show signs of heart failure, the doctors took Julie into surgery immediately to separate the vessels. The surgery was successful and Julie was awake and stable afterward.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to Jeff Phillips for 15 years when he had an affair. Three weeks into her pregnancy, he moved in with his mistress.\n\n===Familial===\nJulie was pregnant with twins.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n201-3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Phillips, Julie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]"}}}]}}}}
