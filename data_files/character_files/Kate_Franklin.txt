In order for him to be able to eat and grow, they had to attach Foker knobs to his back and turn them each day to stretch his esophagus until the two pieces were close enough to be attached with surgery. He had to be put into a medically-induced coma for this process, meaning that his parents couldn't hold him at all, which was difficult for them.\n\nWhen the process was almost completed, Alex accidentally turned too hard and disconnected the knobs, which set them back a few days. They had to re-attached the device and continue bringing the pieces closer and closer. Eventually, they were able to take Lee into surgery and attached the two pieces of his esophagus together.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Chase Franklin]]. Together, they have a son, [[Lee Franklin]].\n\n===Familial===\nHer son, Lee, was born with esophageal atresia. The treatment for that meant that Kate couldn't hold him until it was finished. After the gap was closed and his esophagus was fixed, she was able to hold her son for the first time.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Franklin, Kate}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
