While she was there, she had gastric bypass surgery because she felt pressure from her mother to be thinner.\n\n===Hospitalization===\nThree weeks later, Claire came into the ER after passing out in the shower. She had a fever and abdominal pain. Her parents believed she had just gotten an infection from her trip, but when she was examined, four scars were present on her abdomen. She wouldn't say what they were from, but her scans revealed that she'd had gastric bypass and it was done poorly. She had an abscess and swelling in her bowel. They did the surgery and reversed the bypass, but they had to remove a large portion of her bowel, meaning she'd struggle to get proper nutrition for the rest of her life.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nClaire's mother put immense pressure on her to be thin, which led her to get gastric bypass surgery in Mexico.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 17 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rice, Claire}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
