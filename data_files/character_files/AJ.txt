When it was interrupted by a group of cops coming into the hospital after a robbery, the kids' teacher, [[Marcy (When I Grow Up)|Marcy]], tried to get them taken back to the hospital, but when she couldn't reach the bus driver right away, the kids were instead taken to see the babies. In the nursery, [[Arizona Robbins]] told them how she had performed surgery on one of the babies before he was even born and now he'd been popped out of his mother's womb. AJ asked her what a womb was, a question she struggled to answer.\n\nThe kids were later shown scans of two patients: one with a nail in his head and one with a coffee can in his abdomen. AJ then told that he'd once had a marble stuck up his nose. That's where their tour ended, as their teacher said the bus was there to take them back to school.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He once had a marble stuck up his nose.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x18-2.jpg\n11x18-4.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
