She didn't want to have surgery because she believed it wouldn't work.\n\n[[Richard Webber]] and [[Owen Hunt]] each developed a surgical plan to remove the tumor, believing that gave her the best chance at survival. She initially declined the surgery because she wanted one more month so she'd be able to attend her daughter's wedding. She only agreed to listen to their surgical plans when they said she probably wouldn't make it to the wedding if she didn't have surgery.\n\n[[Derek Shepherd]] listened to both surgical plans and chose Owen's. He explained his plan to the Taylors, but Audrey was still hesitant to have surgery. Her husband then said that their daughter didn't even care about her wedding because her mother was dying. He told her to take the chance and have the surgery because if she had the surgery, she could have years more with her family.\n\nOwen took her into surgery, but he struggled and ended up calling Richard into the OR to help him. They ultimately decided to remove her liver so Richard could remove the tumor while Owen worked on the vasculature. It was successful and she was stable after surgery. Her daughter visited her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Don Taylor]].\n\n===Familial===\nHer daughter, Kim, is engaged to be married. She wanted to be able to attend her daughter's wedding.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taylor, Audrey}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
