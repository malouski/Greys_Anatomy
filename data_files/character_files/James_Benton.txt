He'd been to the clinic three times, but his nose wouldn't stop running. He said he couldn't wait anymore to get better because there was a girl he was dating and he couldn't get close to her because of the constantly running nose. They decided to discharge him, but [[Sydney Heron]] ordered [[Izzie Stevens]] to do a nasal lavage because she wanted to improve patient satisfaction.\n\nAfter his lavage, Bailey attempted to discharge him, but she saw a halo sign on his pillow, so she ordered a head CT. He had a brain herniation and was leaking spinal fluid through his nose. They scheduled him for surgery. After his surgery, he was awake and stable. His girlfriend came to visit him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe's dating a girl. He says it's the kind of relationship where you feel like you're on fire when you're near each other. She came to visit in him in the hospital after his surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Benton, James}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
