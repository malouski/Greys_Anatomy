When Grace was dying, Eleanor, Ruth, and Agnes visited her in the hospital to sit with her. One day, they came in shocked that [[Meredith Grey]] had intubated her. Meredith had been unaware that Grace was on hospice care and had a DNR.\n\nThe three women stayed by Grace's bedside as they waited for [[Alice Bickham]], Grace's daughter, to arrive so she could confirm the DNR and they could remove the tube. When she arrived, they were offered the chance to say a last goodbye, but they said they'd all said goodbye already. They, along with Alice and her girlfriend, sat by Grace's bedside as they removed the tube and she breathed on her own for a few hours and then died.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to Lenny Bickham until his death. He was a quiet man who is said to have been unable to get a word in edgewise. Grace says she misses him terribly.\n\n===Familial===\nShe had a sister, Rose, who died of pneumonia in 1983. She has another sister, Harriet, who also pre-deceased her. She has a daughter, Alice, who held her power of attorney until her death. When she was mistakenly intubated, her daughter came to Seattle to confirm her DNR and say goodbye.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe, Ruth, Eleanor, and Agnes are very close friends. When Grace was dying, the other three were at her bedside.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was pronounced dead at 12:42.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x15-3.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bickham, Grace}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
