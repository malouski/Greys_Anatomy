She went to the ER, where they got an x-ray which showed fractures in two of her metatarsals. She had surgery to repair the fractures, but when she woke up afterward, she believed everyone else was singing when they weren't and believed she was talking when she was actually singing all her words. They got a neuro consult and she had an MRI, which showed no signs of a stroke or bleed. They decided to keep her overnight to monitor her and see if it was a side-effect of the anesthesia. Later that day, she developed a tension pneumothorax. They were able to relieve the pressure and she stabilized, but Herschel realized he just wanted her to be safe and sung to her that he loved her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Vera Kitano]].\n\n==Career==\nHe is a professor at the University of Washington, like his wife.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He once had a car in which the seat belt alert was broken and beeped all the time.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kitano, Herschel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
