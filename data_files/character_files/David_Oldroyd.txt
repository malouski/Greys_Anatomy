He was undergoing chemotherapy to treat the cancer.\n\n===Gurney Crash===\nOn a day that Dave was due to have chemotherapy to treat his cancer, he and his girlfriend, Monica, sneaked out in the parking lot in Monica's parents' car to have sex. While they were doing that, a gurney was blown off the roof and it fell, impaling on the car, breaking through the sunroof, and injuring both Dave and Monica.\n\nThey were both very embarrassed when the doctors came out to free them. [[Jo Wilson]] climbed into the back seat to stabilize their necks while fire and rescue worked to free them. Once the door was removed, Monica was pulled off of Dave's lap and put on a gurney to be taken into the hospital. A blanket was then draped over Dave's lap and he was removed from the car.\n\nIn the ER, [[Callie Torres]] told Dave that his collarbone was broken and his shoulder was seriously bruised. She patched him up and put his arm in a sling. His mother then arrived and had deduced that he was in the parking lot to have sex with Monica.\n\nMonica had to be taken into surgery when she developed a brain bleed. While she was in surgery, Dave was worried about her. When he saw his mom and Callie talking outside his room, he believed that Monica had died and they were trying to figure out how to tell him. When he came out, his mother told him that Monica wasn't dead and comforted him when he was worried that Monica would die.\n\nDave and his mother waited by Monica's bedside after her surgery. When she woke up, he kissed her and cried.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nDavid was dating [[Monica McKeever]]. After her family relocated to Portland for her dad's job, she drove back to [[Seattle]] to see David. However, while they were having sex in her parents' car, a gurney was blown off the roof and fell into the car, injuring both of them.\n\n===Familial===\nDavid's mother was disapproving of David having sex with his girlfriend in the hospital parking lot. However, when Dave was concerned that Monica was going to die, his mother held him and reassured him. She also waited with him for Monica to wake up.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was in room 4883.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x01-22.jpg\n11x01-23.jpg\n11x01-25.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oldroyd, David}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
