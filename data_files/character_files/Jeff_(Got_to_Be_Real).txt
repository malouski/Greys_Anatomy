When he became injured while serving, he had to have his right leg amputated up by his hip. He tried three different prosthetics to learn to walk again, but each one hurt more than the previous one.\n\n===Callie's Trial===\nOwen came out to the rehab facility where Jeff was recovering and told him about the work Callie was doing with prosthetics. Jeff was very interested and when Callie came to see him, he asked her many questions about the prosthetics. She tried to temper his excitement, saying they needed to test his nerves first to see if he would be a candidate for her work. When the EMG revealed that his nerves were controlling his muscles the way she needed them to, she had to break the news to Jeff. However, after speaking with Jackson about it, he said that he could re-route the nerves to control the muscles the way she needed, so they took Jeff into surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhile looking the leg Callie had developed, Jeff asked Owen to take a picture of him with it, saying his mom would love it.\n\n==Career==\nJeff was an Army Ranger until his leg had to be amputated.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x03-4.jpg\n11x03-6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Jeff}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
