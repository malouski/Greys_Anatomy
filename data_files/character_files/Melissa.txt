Meredith Grey was driving by there on her way to work and stopped to help. When she found that Melissa was conscious and having trouble breathing, she convinced several bystanders to work together to lift the car. Once the car was up, Meredith pulled Melissa out from underneath it and Melissa started to breathe again.\n\nMeredith rode with Melissa in the ambulance and took her right into surgery. She was bleeding heavily and had a femur break near her femoral artery. Her blood volume had been replaced completely four times. They reached a point of diminishing returns, so they packed her and took her to the ICU.\n\nThe next morning, her lung collapsed and they had to put in a chest tube. Later that day, Meredith decided it was time to go back in. They were able to stop the bleeding and Melissa woke up in the ICU after surgery and asked for Meredith. She remembered her as the woman who saved her life.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nAfter her accident, her parents were called and were going to come from Toronto.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
