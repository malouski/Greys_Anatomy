When they weren't home, he climbed in a window. The police came and, wrongly believing he was breaking into the house, shot him as he went to call his mom. He was taken to the hospital, where a CT Angio showed the vessel was intact, so they kept him for monitoring and antibiotics. Later, the vessel, weakened by the shot, ruptured and caused him to bleed heavily. He was taken into surgery, but they were unable to repair the damage and Eric died in the OR.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Danisha Sterling]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his wife have three children. The eldest, Eric, was killed by police at the age of 12 climbing in a window of his own house.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\">\n14x10-2.jpg\n14x10-4.jpg\n14x10-5.jpg\n14x10-6.jpg\n14x10-8.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sterling, Martin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
