She had injuries to her head, wrist, and knee. After a CT and x-rays, her wrist was casted and she was told she'd need surgery because an artery under her skull had ruptured, so she was taken into the OR to repair that and the damage to her knee. They were concerned about her fainting spells, which Todd had told them several times, but she admitted that she'd been faking them to get out of answering his questions because she was uncomfortable with the attention he was giving her. She didn't know how close she was to the stairs when she fainted in the park.\n\nAfter Hillary's surgery, Todd was relieved to see that she was okay and said that he'd never leave her and she'd be okay. [[Callie Torres|Callie]] gestured from behind Todd, encouraging Hillary to break up with him. When she didn't do this and instead faked a fainting spell to get out of it, Callie took the reigns, explaining the situation to Todd as she led him out the door. Once he was gone, Hillary thanked Callie.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHillary was dating a man named Todd. She said he was great, but more affectionate than she was comfortable with. He liked to pet her and lavish her with attention. When he proposed, she faked a fainting spell which landed her in the hospital. After she woke up from surgery, [[Callie Torres]] broke up with Todd for her.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 27 at the time of her hospitalization.\n*Her ex-boyfriend, [[Todd]], used to pet her.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List, Hillary}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
