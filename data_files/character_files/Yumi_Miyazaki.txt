Okamoto]]\n}}\n'''Yumi Miyazaki''' is a competitive eater who came into the hospital with persistent hiccups.\n\n==History==\nYumi came into the ER with persistent hiccups that had started a few days before. They gave her chlorpromazine, which stopped them for a while, but they came back. The doctors scheduled an esophogram, but her coach, [[Kamaji]], tried to get them to give her more of the medicine in order to stop the hiccups, so she could compete in her last competition for a while, a suggestion that was quickly dismissed.\n\nThe esophogram revealed a tear in her esophagus, probably caused by her competitive eating. She needed surgery to repair it and Bailey suggested that she give up competitive eating. When Kamaji asked for privacy to break the news to Yumi, Bailey stepped out and asked Alex to get a translator to make sure Yumi was getting the facts.\n\nWhen the translator arrived, Yumi wasn't in her room and [[Nurse Kate]] informed Alex that she'd left with Kamaji.\n\nYumi went to compete at The Taste of Seattle, but she was brought back to the ER vomiting up blood. They rushed her into surgery to repair her esophagus.\n\nAfter her surgery, she was awake and stable. Kamaji came into her room and apologized to her for ending her career.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nShe came into the ER with her coach, [[Kamaji]]. When he lied to her about the severity of her condition, she ended up back in the hospital in worse condition.\n\n==Career==\nYumi is a competitive eater. She's successful enough to be recognized by sports fans.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She doesn't speak English.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miyazaki, Yumi}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
