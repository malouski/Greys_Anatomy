He said he talks to dead people and his family thought he was dangerous. After he was admitted, he had two seizures, so he had to be cleared by surgery before he could be returned to psych. While they examined him, he had another seizure, but he claimed it was a vision. He said someone on the fourth floor would die. Immediately afterward, a code blue was called for the fourth floor.\n\nThey ran a scan which showed the seizures, so Cristina ordered an MRI to get a better look at his brain. When he predicted her pregnancy, Cristina asked to be moved off the case. Izzie took over. She ran a scan that showed an arteriovenous malformation in his temporal lobe.\n\nMr. Duff was told he needed surgery, but he declined consent, still convinced it was visions and not seizures. Izzie talked to him, saying that if he really did have a gift, he needed to believe that the gift would still be there after he had the surgery. He agreed to have the surgery. After surgery, he woke up and was still having his visions.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nAfter he told them he talked to dead people, his family had him admitted to the psychiatric ward because they believed he was dangerous.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He gave Izzie the missing ingredient from her cupcakes and called her Cricket, her mother's nickname for her.\n*He figured out that Cristina was pregnant.\n*He told [[Debbie]] to stay away from anesthesiologists.
