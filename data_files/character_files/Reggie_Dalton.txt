He'd had surgery six months prior and after a while, the hernia developed. He'd had it checked out before, but they said it wasn't urgent, so he put off surgery. But it was allergy season and every time he sneezed, it popped out. He sneezed in the ER and Jo was surprised to see that it was very, very large.\n\nBecause of its size, he needed a special surgery to repair it. He started to push it in, saying he'd gotten good at it because of how long it had been. They planned surgery for the next day.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dalton, Reggie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
