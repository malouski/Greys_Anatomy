No treatment that they'd tried had worked. They said they could try a frontal lobotomy to treat the pain, a radical choice, but wanted to exhaust all other options first. While they were examining him, Lexie had an idea. She thought Barry needed an ENT. Mark examined the patient and found that he had an anterior ethmoid neurovascular complex that was the source of his pain. He needed a middle turbinectomy to fix it.\n\nThey took him into surgery, but had to close shortly after starting because the roof caved in on another OR snd that patient had to be moved into the one they were using. So Barry was transferred to another hospital to have his surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married until his wife died. He said that when she died, he couldn't feel it because the pain in his head was so overwhelming. He loved her and she spent the last years of her life driving him from doctor to doctor.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 63 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He said his pain was always at an eight.\n*He'd seen 16 ENTs before Mark.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n5x03-46.jpg\n5x03-47.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Patmore, Barry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
