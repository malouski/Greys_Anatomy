They were called to the hospital because a donor had finally been located to give Zachary new arms. There was a possible complication when they found a tattoo on one of the arms, but both Nora and Zack said they were okay with it. The first arm was transplanted easily, but the second had a problem. Nora was told they might not be able to transplant the second arm. Her response was that one arm was better than none.
