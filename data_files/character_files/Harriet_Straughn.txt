When the paramedics arrived, they were unable to find a pulse, so they believed that Hattie was dead. However, after they got Norris to let go, [[Meredith Grey]] found a pulse.\n\nHattie had bleeding in her lungs and a skull fracture as well as a cerebral spinal fluid leak. [[Amelia Shepherd]] went to update Hattie's daughter, [[Sarah Straughn|Sarah]], on her parents' conditions, but Sarah recognized Amelia as a drug addict whom she had met in Narcotics Anonymous and demanded that she be taken off the case. Derek took over and Hattie was taken into surgery, where a portion of one of her lungs was removed and her CSF leak was repaired without opening her skull.\n\nAfter their surgeries, Hattie and Norris were reunited, awake and stable. When Hattie found out what Norris had done, she said it was stupid.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHattie is married to [[Norris Straughn]]. They have a daughter together.\n\n===Familial===\nNorris and Hattie have one daughter, [[Sarah Straughn|Sarah]]. Sarah is a recovering drug addict who attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings in [[Seattle]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Harriet is the last patient to be operated on by Derek on screen.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x07-5.jpg\n11x07-6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Straughn, Harriet}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
