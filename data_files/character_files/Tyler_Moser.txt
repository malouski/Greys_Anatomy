He had four spinal fusions to try to relieve his symptoms, but they were only temporary solutions.\n\n===Callie's Plan===\nIn order to find a solution that would be permanent, Callie came up with a three-day, three-part surgery which would relieve Tyler's symptoms. The plan was for them to remove the old hardware, then take down the scar tissue, and then implant the new cage. After his first surgery, his nerve function was tested every 30 minutes to make sure there was no nerve damage.\n\nHe was taken back in the next day for his second surgery. However, Callie was forced to close early and reframe her plan. She was able to find an alternate way to operate and despite some complications in his third surgery, the procedure was successful.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nAfter his final surgery, Tyler told his parents that he was grateful that they had dropped everything to take care of him after his car accident, but he told them to get a divorce because it was clear that they hated each other.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moser, Tyler}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
