The doctors planned to harvest bone from her own skull to build her new cheekbones. However, [[Mark Sloan]] proposed using cadaver bones instead, because Sarah expressed interest in playing sports, which might not be possible with harvested bone. [[Arizona Robbins]] rejected the idea as being too experimental, but eventually relented. Sarah's parents were worried about the more experimental surgery, but agreed to let her have it when she said that being able to play sports was important to her. Her surgery was performed successfully.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Jared Cassidy]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe was concerned about Sarah having the more experimental surgery, but agreed to let her have it after she said she just wanted to be able to play sports.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cassidy, Sophia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
