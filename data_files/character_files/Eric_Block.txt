He even came in with designs. However, he was disappointed to hear that Meredith wanted him to read every line of the research she had done before allowing him to touch the 3D printer. She assigned [[Stephanie Edwards]] to monitor him as he read. When she checked on him, she discovered him doodling and told him to get back to reading, but noticed one of his doodles and asked him how it would theoretically work.\n\nWhen Meredith came back to find that Stephanie had allowed Eric to use the printer, he panicked because he thought he was about to be fired. But she explained the history of her research and how she wanted to get it out of the basement and saving people\u2019s lives. She then sat down to go over a few things with him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\n====[[Meredith Grey]]====\nMeredith initially didn\u2019t trust him and wouldn\u2019t allow him to touch the 3D printer. However, she warmed up to him and was more willing to work with him.\n\n==Career==\nEric is a bioengineer who was hired by [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] to further her portal vein research.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Eric beat out over 100 other bioengineers to work with Meredith.\n*He was horrified by the image of [[Greg Penderglass|Greg Penderglass\u2019]] fetus in fetu.\n*Eric was a potentially recurring character, but he only appeared in one episode. Seeing how Meredith has confirmed recently that her research failed, Eric will almost certainly not appear in future episodes.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x16-1.jpg\n10x16-2.jpg\n10x16-3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Block, Eric}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
