While an intern, her resident was [[Izzie Stevens]] until reassigned to [[George O'Malley]].\n\n==History==\n===Internship===\nOn her first day of internship, she was assigned to [[Izzie Stevens]], who took the group on a tour of the hospital and used the same new intern speech that Bailey had used for her class to introduce them to the rules. Her interns viewed her as the dud, having heard that she'd spent some time on probation after killing someone.\n\nAfter they spent the day saving a deer with Izzie, she said that they were the dud interns.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the new interns were in awe of George, who had delivered a baby that day, on what they all thought was his first ever shift as an intern. ''(\"[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\")''\n\n===Callie and Izzie's Fight===\nWhen the rumor spread that Callie and Izzie were going to fight in the hospital cafeteria, the interns, along with several other hospital staffers, gathered to watch it happen. However, Callie hadn't intended to fight and the interns were disappointed, calling it a forfeit on Callie's part. ''(\"[[The Heart of the Matter]]\")''\n\n===George's Housewarming Party===\nClaire, Graciella, Leo, and Mitch all attended a housewarming party thrown by George and Lexie. They all ended up coming to work drunk the next day. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n===Darts Tournament===\nThe night after the party, the interns planned a darts tournament. When George invited Izzie, they started considering dropping out because they didn't want to play darts with their boss. ''(\"[[Piece of My Heart]]\")''\n\n===Intern Exchange===\nWhen [[George O'Malley]] became a resident and the other residents had to choose an intern each to give to him, they lined all the interns up in the cafeteria and discussed their pros and cons right in front of them as they decided. ''(\"[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\")''\n\n===Skills Lab===\nOwen stabbed four pigs as part of a skills lab and the interns and residents worked to keep them alive. ''(\"[[Life During Wartime]]\")''\n\n===Intern Cabal===\nFrustrated that the residents weren't teaching them, the interns began to practice IVs on each other. When [[Lexie Grey]] found out that some unclaimed bodies were being preserved for medical research, she took a few of them for the interns to practice things on. However, the residents also took the cadavers, so they continued to practice on themselves. ''(\"[[Rise Up]]\")''\n\nThe interns continued to practice and were joined by [[Sadie Harris]]. Cristina became suspicious when Lexie knew the parallel pulley stitch, something she hadn't taught her, which led to her discovering what they were doing. She told them to shut it down. ''(\"[[These Ties That Bind]]\")''\n\nThe interns then gave Steve an epidural as practice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n===Sadie's Appendectomy===\nThe interns wanted to remove Steve's appendix while he was on the epidural, but he refused, so Sadie volunteered as long as she could remove one of theirs when they were done. They numbed her and Lexie used a book to guide her as she prepared to operate. When she hesitated, Sadie took the scalpel and made the first cut herself. When Lexie got to the appendix, it was inflamed, meaning this wasn't a routine procedure. Graciella said they should call a resident and then decided to leave when they wouldn't do it. Cristina then figured out that they hadn't shut it down like she told them to. Lexie came to Meredith because Sadie became unstable. Meredith and Cristina took over the surgery. They sent for Bailey and managed to save Sadie's life. The interns were then called in to present her case, admitting that they made choices that compromised her care. They were all then placed on probation until further notice. ''(\"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\")''\n\n===Solo Surgery===\nThe day that the winner of the solo surgery was to be announced, Steve, Graciella, Ryan, and Lexie waited outside the room and made several false announcements the residents eagerly waited to hear. ''(\"[[All By Myself]]\")''\n\n===Intern Contest===\nWanting to remind the interns, who were still on probation, why they loved medicine, [[Izzie Stevens]] put together a medical contest for them, which involved diagnosing patients based on symptoms presented to them and draping patients for specific surgeries. ''(\"[[Before and After]]\")''\n\n===Patient X===\nAfter finding out she had cancer, Izzie took her scans and lab results and showed them to the interns, challenging them to diagnosis a patient she called \"Patient X.\" ''(\"[[An Honest Mistake]]\")''\n\nThey continued working on Patient X and presented a few ideas to Izzie. After more tests, they decided that Patient X was fine, before Izzie told them she was not fine. At the end of the day, they presented their final diagnosis: metastatic melanoma, with mets to the skin, liver, and brain. Her prognosis was very poor. They asked Izzie what their prize was, but she said the prize is that they didn't screw it up. ''(\"[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\")''\n\n===Waiting for Izzie===\nWhen Izzie went into surgery to have the mets removed from her brain, the interns waited outside the OR. The residents let them because people are better than no people. ''(\"[[Elevator Love Letter]]\")''\n\n===George's Death===\nGraciella was affected by George's death. ''(\"[[Good Mourning]]\")''\n\n===Hospital Merger===\nWhen the merger between [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and [[Mercy West Medical Center]] was announced, the interns all began working around the clock, because they were scared to go home out of fear that they'd end up getting cut from the program. She survived the first round of layoffs. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n===Documentary===\nGraciella participated in a documentary someone made about the doctors at the hospital. During the documentary, she went through two different relationships and decided to rethink her approach. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n===Hospital Shooting===\nGraciella was locked down in peds when [[Gary Clark]] brought a gun to the hospital. She informed [[Arizona Robbins]] and [[Callie Torres]] when [[Ruby Kendall|Ruby Kendall's]] appendix burst. ''(\"[[Sanctuary]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Pierce Halley]]====\nShe and Pierce dated for two weeks after Megan left him. She broke up with him when she saw him talking to Megan. He was unaffected by the news. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n====[[Charles Percy]]====\nShe developed a crush on Charles after dumping Pierce. They hung out at the bar together, but he made it clear they were just friends. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n===Friendships===\nGraciella was one of the many interns who befriended George and went to his intern parties. She was also one of the many that knew Lexie loved George.\n\nShe and [[Steve Mostow]] are best friends. ''(\"[[Seattle Grace: On Call]]\")''\n\n===Professional===\nShe originally disliked Izzie, calling her a \"dud\" resident. When Izzie came back to work, Graciella was much nicer, claiming that her mother's church prayed for Izzie. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nDr. Guzman originally worked as an [[Internship|intern]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She worked as an intern first for Izzie and then for George. She was part of the secret intern society but when the interns were about to operate on Sadie, she left as she felt scared.\n\nWhen Izzie was debating which intern to give to George, she said \"''Graciella charts like crap. But she can put in a line''\".\n\nDr. Guzman became a second year [[Resident|resident]] and survived the first round of lay-offs when [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] merged with [[Mercy West Medical Center]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Graciella was originally credited as ''Graziella''.\n*Graciella is religious.<ref>[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]], 6x03</ref>\n*She doesn't chart well, but she can put in a line.<ref>[[There's No 'I' in Team]], 5x05</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n401InternGraciella.png|[[A Change is Gonna Come]]\n403InternGraziella.png|[[Let the Truth Sting]]\n404InternGraziella.png|[[The Heart of the Matter]]\n413InternGraziella.png|[[Piece of My Heart]]\n503Interns2.png|[[Here Comes the Flood]]\n504InternGraciella.png|[[Brave New World]]\n505InternGraciella.png|[[There's No 'I' in Team]]\n507InternGraciella.png|[[Rise Up]]\n508InternGraciella.png|[[These Ties That Bind]]\n509InternGraciella.png|[[In the Midnight Hour]]\n510InternGraciella.png|[[All By Myself]]\n511InternGraciella.png|[[Wish You Were Here]]\n512Interns.png|[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\n515InternGraciella.png|[[Before and After]]\n516InternGraciella.png|[[An Honest Mistake]]\n517InternGraciella.png|[[I Will Follow You Into the Dark]]\n519InternGraciella.png|[[Elevator Love Letter]]\n6x01MeganGraciella.png|[[Good Mourning]]\n6x03GraciellaClaire.png|[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\n6x05GraciellaGuzman.png|[[Invasion]]\n6x23GraciellaGuzman.png|[[Sanctuary]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x01-11.jpg\n4x01-14.jpg\n4x01-16.jpg\n4x03-2.jpg\n4x03-8.jpg\n5x06-13.jpg\n5x06-14.jpg\n5x07-17.jpg\n6x23-15.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Graciella Guzman Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Graciella Guzman]]\n[[fr:Graciella Guzman]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guzman, Graciella}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Webisode Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
