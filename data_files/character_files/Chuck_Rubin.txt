Callie was horrified at the state of his legs, which were still pinned and the surgical incision sites still open and heavily infected. In surgery, Callie and Mark had no choice but to reverse the procedure and remove all the diseased bone and tissue, taking his height to a quarter below 5'3\", which is where he started.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe's extremely jealous of his brother, Gary, who is over six feet tall.
