Bailey went to see her, as Meredith wasn't working, and convinced Nina to let her work on her case as she had been Meredith's teacher. Nina had been having severe abdominal pain and the doctors hadn't been able to discover a cause. Bailey and Jo worked strategically, testing everything they could. At the end of the day, the tests had revealed nothing. Nina refused to accept that and said they needed to work harder. Then she ate her sandwich, which she had packed to eat after her tests, because she was always hungry from fasting for blood work. Soon after, she started writhing in pain. Bailey performed an ultrasound, which revealed that she had a ligament wrapped around her celiac artery, which expanded when she ate, causing the pain. They scheduled surgery to cut the ligament for the next day.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe inherited an auto shop from her father when he retired after 45 years. He taught her everything she knows about cars and also gave her his lunch pail.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a mechanic. She inherited her father's auto shop when he retired.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Before coming to Grey Sloan, she saw an internist, two gastroenterologists, and two surgeons who couldn't figure out her problem.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sullivan, Nina}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
