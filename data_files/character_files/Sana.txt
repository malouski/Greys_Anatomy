In the tent, they placed a chest tube. When they went to transport her, the tube came out, so they had to replace it, which was extremely painful. After the tube was replaced, she was put on a helicopter to be evacuated. Unbeknownst to Megan, Sana was the second shooter. Megan got on the helicopter with her, despite [[Teddy Altman|Teddy]] trying to warn her, which led to Megan being kidnapped and held captive for ten years.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe has a brother.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x05-7.jpg\n14x05-12.jpg\n14x05-19.jpg\n14x05-21.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
