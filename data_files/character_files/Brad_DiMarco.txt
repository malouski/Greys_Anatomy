They were all doing mushrooms and decided to set off some fireworks. They were interrupted by the firefighters of station 19, who informed them that setting off fireworks in the park was illegal. However, Brad lit another one and it exploded directly in his face, seriously injuring him. All the friends panicked and Tara's ankle was injured in the ensuing chaos. All the friends begged the firefighters to save Brad and then Will, in a misguided attempt to help Brad, climbed into the fire engine and started to drive it out of the park. He drove it into the intersection, where it was t-boned by a delivery van and tipped on its side, trapping Will inside. While some firefighters worked to free Will, others worked on Brad, using a t-shirt to stem the bleeding from his face while they waited for an aid car to arrive. Tara frantically told them they had to save him because she loved him and he'd saved her life by dragging her out of the house after the pandemic, saying she needed to celebrate the fact that she'd lived when so many hadn't.\n\nBecause the accident will caused blocked the intersection and backed up traffic, the aid car was unable to get to the park, forcing them to walk the gurney to the park on foot and then walk Brad back to the hospital. Tara followed them despite having an injured ankle. ''(\"[[Phoenix from the Flame]]\")''\n\nAt the hospital, Brad's injuries were assessed then he was taken into surgery, where [[Michelle Lin]] did the first of what she said would be multiple surgeries to fix his face.
