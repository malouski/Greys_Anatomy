She was the result of a one-night stand her mother had following her divorce. After she was born, she wasn't breathing or moving, so she was quickly intubated and then taken to the NICU, where she was stable. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\nAfter her birth, Luna was put on a ventilator as she continued to grow and develop. Her mother spoke to her over the phone as much as she was able to. ''(\"[[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\nLuna developed a bronchogenic cyst, which required surgery to remove. When they told Val that Luna needed surgery, she was upset because Luna had not been able to be held in her whole life and she was worried Luna was scared and confused. Jo promise she'd bring Luna to see her before her surgery, but before she could, Val coded and eventually died while Luna was in surgery. Luna's surgery went well and she was stable in the NICU afterward. Jo sat with her and held her hand. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")''\n\nJo continued visiting Luna in the NICU and holding her. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nBailey and Cormac also began visiting Luna and talking to her about the outside world. Jo became convinced she was reacting to the sound of her own name. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\nInspired by a patient telling his great-granddaughter the story of her family, Jo visited Luna in the NICU and told her about her mother and how every time Jo entered the ER, she thought of Val and of Luna. ''(\"[[Tradition]]\")''\n\nThe weeks she'd spent intubated left Luna with very little gag reflex. She started spitting up after every feed and experienced drops in her heart rate each time. Her newly-assigned legal guardian, [[Carmen Delgado]], came to the hospital to check on her and Cormac told Carmen he was going to run labs to confirm a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. A week later, the diagnosis was confirmed, so they tried sitting her upright for feedings and giving her smaller amounts more frequently. When her condition worsened, Cormac proposed a Nissen fundoplication to stop the reflux. However, her social worker and legal guardian would not consent to the surgery. ''(\"[[I'm Still Standing]]\")''\n\nLater, Carmen changed her mind and allowed Luna to have the surgery, which went well. When Carmen mentioned that she had a family in mind who wanted to foster to adopt Luna, Jo decided she needed to get a lawyer and fight for custody of Luna. She had Link and Amelia temporarily foster Luna while she worked with the lawyer to get her record cleared and her adoption approved, to keep anyone else from adopting her. Finally, in April 2021, Jo was able to take Luna home with her. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Jo's Return to Work===\nOn the day she was supposed to return to work, Jo took Luna to the hospital. However, she ended up spending the entire day in the hospital parking lot, unable to take Luna in to the daycare. She worried Luna was feeling the same sense of abandonment Jo felt when her mother left her at the fire station as an infant. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nDespite this initial hiccup, Luna did eventually start attending the daycare while her mother worked. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother, Val, wanted a child for a long time before she was born. When she found out she was pregnant, even though she was at high risk for bleeding, she was happy. Not long after she was born, her father signed over his rights to her, then her mother died. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")'' After Val died, Jo began spending more time with Luna and eventually adopted her. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her birth mother knew what her name would be from the time she was herself a young girl.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n17x03LunaAshton.png|[[My Happy Ending]]\n17x05LunaAshton.png|[[Fight the Power]]\n17x07LunaAshton.png|[[Helplessly Hoping]]\n17x10LunaAshton.png|[[Breathe]]\n17x11LunaAshton.png|[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\n17x13LunaAshton.png|[[Good as Hell]]\n17x15LunaAshton.png|[[Tradition]]\n17x16LunaAshton.png|[[I'm Still Standing]]\n17x17LunaAshton.png|[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\n18x01LunaAshton.png|[[Here Comes the Sun]]\n18x04LunaAshton.png|[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x13-43.jpg\n17x13-44.jpg\n17x13-46.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Luna Ashton Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ashton, Luna}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neonatal)]]"}}}]}}}}
