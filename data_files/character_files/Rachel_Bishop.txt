She was doing well, not able to talk, but able to respond to verbal commands, the next day, so [[Amelia Shepherd]] decided to try early ambulation, getting her up on her feet early in order to improve her outcome. On their first attempt, the goal was to get her to the edge of the bed, but they had to stop when she reached her point of intolerance, indicated by her vomiting. They made a second attempt, but she started hitting [[Stephanie Edwards]] with her fist, indicating that she didn't want to continue. Due to personal reasons, Stephanie had to step out of the room and she sent in [[Jo Wilson]] to try to get Rachel out of bed to the chair.\n\nLater that day, Stephanie returned to Rachel and was able to get her out of bed and into the chair, encouraging her to focus on hitting Stephanie the whole way there.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother had been to visit her in the hospital when she had her craniotomy. When the doctors decided to try early ambulation, Amelia asked that her mother be asked not to visit that day because she knew it would be a difficult process.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 32 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" bordersize=\"none\">\n12x04-45.jpg\n12x04-47.jpg\n12x04-51.jpg\n12x04-52.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bishop, Rachel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
