They built the bazooka to exact specifications, but when they tried to use it, it didn't fire like it was supposed to. James went to check on it and then it started working and fired a shell into James's chest.\n\nPaul came to the hospital to check on James and was yelled at by [[Mindy Carlson|James's wife]], who hated their hobby. During their argument, Paul revealed that the shell hadn't detonated, meaning there was an active bomb in James's chest.\n\nWhen the Bomb Squad arrived, Paul helped them by telling him everything he knew about the shell they had built.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nHe and [[James Carlson]] are best friends. They're both World War II enthusiasts and they often work together to re-enact.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Paul}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
