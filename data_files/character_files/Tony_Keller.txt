They used a clothesline to play. The tugging motion led to [[Cash Keller|Cash]], [[Deedee Keller|Deedee]], and [[Jane Keller|Jane]] losing fingers. [[Frances Keller]] was also injured in the game when her hand was crushed.\n\nThe family went together to the ER, where the fingers were matched with their rightful owners. All the fingers were successfully re-attached and Frances was expected to regain full use of her hand after physical therapy. However, when Al tried to say that that it was good that they had family, his brother, Tony, punched him in the face, giving Al a nosebleed and possibly breaking Tony's hand.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Jane Keller]]. They have a daughter together, [[Frances Keller]].\n\n===Familial===\nHis daughter, Frankie, as well as his wife, sister, and nephew, were injured during a game of tug-o-war at their family reunion. Tony blamed his brother [[Al Keller|Al]] for their injuries.\n\n===Friendships===\nTony's friend, Gunnar, accompanied them to the family reunion despite not being related to the family.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keller, Tony}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
