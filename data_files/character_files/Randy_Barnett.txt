She'd previously been told that it was probably a migraine, but since the medicine didn't work, she came back into the ER with Randy. While describing the pain to Meredith, Janell had a seizure, so Meredith had Derek paged and called for an EEG.\n\nJanell wasn't responding to the migraine medication, so Derek suggested putting her in a medically-induced coma so that the seizures wouldn't damage her brain. Randy agreed and Janell was put into a coma.\n\nMeredith noticed that Janell was having a hemolytic anemia, which indicated an autoimmune response. Meredith figured out that she had a teratoma. They found a mass on her lung that she believed was the teratoma, so they scheduled surgery to remove it. However, after they removed it, pathology determined that the mass was a benign granuloma, so the search for the teratoma continued.\n\nThe most likely location of the tumor was in her ovaries, so they went back to Randy to ask him about it and he said that Janell wanted kids, so he refused to let them remove her ovaries.\n\nIn surgery, they noticed a lot of adhesions on her right ovary, which could indicate a tumor, so they removed the right to examine it for microscopic tumors. When it came back clean, they removed her other ovary, effectively sterilizing her.\n\nThe pathologist looked at the specimen. He said that he needed to look at more slides to confirm it, but Meredith pushed him aside and looked at it herself. Then she and Bailey pushed him to say it was a teratoma.\n\nAfter the surgery, Janell's coma was reversed and she was pain-free.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nRandy is married to [[Janell Barnett]]. They have known each other since high school and he considers her his better half.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barnett, Randy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
