On the day of the wedding, she became frantic because everyone got lost on the way to the wedding location. Later, when it became clear the wedding was going to be seriously delayed when the bride and groom disappeared, she passed around a microphone so people could give toasts. After the first toast, she took back the microphone to ask for an EpiPen because she had accidentally eaten shrimp, to which she is allergic. Several of the doctors stepped in to help her.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a wedding planner.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She is allergic to shrimp.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x24-49.jpg\n14x24-50.jpg\n14x24-51.jpg\n14x24-52.jpg\n14x24-53.jpg\n14x24-54.jpg\n14x24-55.jpg\n14x24-56.jpg\n14x24-57.jpg\n14x24-58.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
