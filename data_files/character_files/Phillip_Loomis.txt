The impact crushed his spine and left him paralyzed. Derek said he'd do a spinal decompression, but it was unlikely Phillip would walk again. Owen then suggested therapeutic hypothermia to treat the paralysis.\n\nCallie did research into therapeutic hypothermia and suggested they try it on him.

She helped them stabilize him and then they were able to start warming him back up. Afterward, he was able to move his toes.
