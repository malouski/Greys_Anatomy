He was examined in the ER and an x-ray was ordered to confirm. It confirmed the break, but also revealed a mass, which a biopsy showed was osteosarcoma. J.J.'s mother, Michelle, was worried about him dying and J.J. was worried about being bald, but Link reassured them both, saying he had the same kind of cancer when he was a kid and survived and letting J.J. cut his hair.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhen she learned her son had cancer, she was worried about him dying. Link spoke to her privately and said the worst part for him when he had the same kind of cancer as a kid was seeing his mother so sad all the time. He encouraged her to let J.J. see her smile at least once a day.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Michelle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
