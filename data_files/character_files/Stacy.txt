While she was gone, they found Brandon's mom's gun and Peter accidentally shot Brandon with it. Stacy went with the kids to the ER, where she was the one to tell Brandon and Peter's moms that the kids had found [[Patricia Cole|Patricia's]] gun and that's how Brandon was shot.\n\nMaggie later asked Stacy how she was away from the kids for long enough for them to find a gun and fire it. Stacy defended that they aren't babies. They're eight and she should be able to leave them alone long enough to warm up their food.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n12x20-25.jpg\n12x20-26.jpg\n12x20-31.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
