Once her husband and kids were out of the room, Rose asked Addison to tie her tubes while she was in there doing the c-section. She'd been saving up so that she could pay for it because if they billed insurance, her husband would see it and he's a devout Catholic, so she couldn't let him know. She said that she believed God would understand, but her husband wouldn't.\n\nAddison agreed to do the surgery and after delivering the baby, she pretended she saw bleeding that necessitated tubal ligation. Addison told her after the surgery that she wouldn't be able to have any more babies. She then told her husband, because she wanted him to know Joseph would be their last baby. Chris then went to Alex and asked him about the alleged complication, which led to Alex telling him to get a lawyer.\n\nAddison went to Rose, trying to get her to tell Chris what had happened, but Rose said she wouldn't, saying it was her whole marriage and Addison's malpractice insurance would pay out the claim.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Chris Ward (Blues for Sister Someone)|Chris Ward]]. Together, they have seven children. Rose loves Chris, but when she was pregnant with their seventh child, she decided she didn't want to have anymore because the seven they had were so stressful for her, so she secretly had her tubes tied. She told Chris that she was left infertile only because she wanted him to know that their newest child would be their last.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband have seven children. She loves her kids, but they were a source of a lot of stress and fatigue for her. She'd been hospitalized in the past twice for exhaustion and once for dehydration. Four of her children were born via caesarean and three vaginally.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*When they were first married, she went on the pill because they were so broke and her husband stopped taking communion during that time.\n*There was a four-year gap between Joseph and the one before him, due in part to Rose and her husband abstaining from sex for three years.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ward, Rose}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
