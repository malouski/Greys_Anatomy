After his transplant, he came into the ER with abdominal pain. Alex examined him and said he had signs of appendicitis, but because of the immunosuppressants he was on to keep his kidney, surgery was dangerous for him. They decided to give him antibiotics and watch him. His heart rate increased, but Alex believed it was because he was just jumpy from being hospitalized. However, his infection had worsened and his appendix ruptured. He was taken into emergency surgery and his appendix was removed. After his appendectomy, he developed a clot in the artery of his kidney, so he was taken back into surgery and they worried he'd lose the kidney. Before surgery, he asked for Alex. Alex was given a moment to talk to him and reminded him that as bad as it gets, nothing's as bad as broccoli. In surgery, they were able to remove the clot and he got to keep his kidney.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis mother came to the hospital with him and worried about him losing his new kidney.\n\n===Professional===\nHe had a good relationship with Alex from the time Alex had been treating him. When Alex wasn't there before he went into surgery, Zach asked for him and wondered why he wasn't there.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He hates broccoli. Alex got him through his medical issues by reminding him that no matter what happens, it's not as bad as broccoli.\n*He was in room 4625.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thompson, Zach}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
