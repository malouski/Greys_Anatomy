She met his wife, [[Jo Wilson]], and left the two of them to sign their divorce papers. As they two of them went to leave, Jo stopped them by having [[Arizona Robbins]] distract Paul and take him away so she could speak to Jenny privately. Jenny denied any abuse and refused any help from Jo. Despite this, Jo related her own history with Paul's abuse and gave Jenny her card with her cell phone number on the back. After she left with Paul, Jenny told him what Jo had said and showed him the card. He came back to confront Jo about it and said that while Jenny didn't need the card, he was going to keep it for himself.

''(\"[[1-800-799-7233]]\")''\n\nJenny spoke to the police about the incident and told Jo she didn't tell them that Jo hit Paul, which she believed to be the truth. Jenny thanked her for doing that, but then learned that Jo didn't hit him. Despite this, she spoke to Jo and said she couldn't believe what she'd done, how she'd gotten sucked into an abusive relationship. She vowed to tell the police everything Paul had done to her. She went to confront him and when she did, he became angry and tried to attack her, but he slipped and hit his head on the way, rendering him brain dead. She regretted this as she had wanted him to rot in jail for what he'd done, but she and Jo talked about it and decided to donate Paul's organs so that something good would come of his death since his life brought evil. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is engaged to [[Paul Stadler]]. When talking to Jo, she claimed they were happy and denied any abuse. ''(\"[[1-800-799-7233]]\")'' Jenny later decided to go to the police about what he'd done to her, which angered him. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n===Familial===\nAfter starting to see Paul, she slowly cut off contact with her family when they became concerned about him, narrowing her social circle until it was just him.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a scientist.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She considers herself a feminist.<ref>[[Personal Jesus]], 14x10</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n14x09Jenny.png|[[1-800-799-7233]]\n14x10Jenny.png|[[Personal Jesus]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x09-1.jpg\n14x09-25.jpg\n14x09-26.jpg\n14x09-27.jpg\n14x09-28.jpg\n14x09-29.jpg\n14x09-30.jpg\n14x09-31.jpg\n14x09-32.jpg\n14x09-33.jpg\n14x09-34.jpg\n14x09-36.jpg\n14x09-37.jpg\n14x09-38.jpg\n14x09-39.jpg\n14x09-40.jpg\n14x09-42.jpg\n14x09-43.jpg\n14x09-44.jpg\n14x09-45.jpg\n14x09-46.jpg\n14x09-48.jpg\n14x09-49.jpg\n14x09-50.jpg\n14x09-51.jpg\n14x09-52.jpg\n14x09-53.jpg\n14x09-54.jpg\n14x09-55.jpg\n14x09-56.jpg\n14x09-57.jpg\n14x10-17.jpg\n14x10-18.jpg\n14x10-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Jenny Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Jenny}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
