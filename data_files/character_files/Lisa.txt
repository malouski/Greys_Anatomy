After seeing that she was alone and scared, Meredith let the girl stay with her. Meredith explained to [[Derek Shepherd|Derek]] that the girl couldn't find her mother, but she soon handed Lisa off to another adult and went off to help a man by the pier. The person she left Lisa with walked away and Lisa followed Meredith. The girl was too afraid to speak, but helped Meredith by handing her equipment. When treating the patient, he accidentally kicked her into the water due to the pain in his leg. ''(\"[[Walk on Water]]\")''\n\nDerek walked by later, searching for Meredith. He asked Lisa if she knew where Meredith was and she pointed to the water.\n\nLater, she was taken to [[Seattle Grace Hospital|Seattle Grace]], where she found her mother. ''(\"[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*On a blog, [[Shonda Rhimes]] said this about the little girl: ''The little girl? She's also a metaphor for Mer. A motherless lost girl who can't speak for herself and disappears? Okay, that's too obvious. But you all know Meredith's been doing a dance with death for some time. Y'all know that if you've been watching. She's dark, our girl. She's dark and twisty.''\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n315LisatheChild.png|[[Walk on Water]]\n316LisatheChild.png|[[Drowning on Dry Land]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Lisa the Child Appearances}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
