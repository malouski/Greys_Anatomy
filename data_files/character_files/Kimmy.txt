The baby was born with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. He was intubated so he could breathe. Kimmy kept questioning what was going on while that was happening, echoed by her mother. His SATs were still low, so he was taken to be hooked up to ECMO. Kimmy was most interested in how quickly she'd be able to take the baby home because she was supposed to be at a party her friend Nikki was throwing for her. She declined the chance to see her son, instead going back to her own room. [[Jo Wilson]] found her and her mother getting on the elevator. When she figured out they were planning to leave without Kimmy being discharged, she tried telling them they couldn't leave, then ended up physically fighting with Kimmy's mom. Her efforts failed.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nKimmy's mother was very aggressive in advocating for her daughter, but neither of them expressed interest in staying to take care of Kimmy's son once they discovered he'd be sick for a while.\n\n===Friendships===\nKimmy's friend, Nikki, was throwing a party for her to which she was meant to bring her baby.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was fifteen when she gave birth to her son.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
