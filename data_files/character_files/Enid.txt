However, because of her age, she needed a cardiac stress test to make sure her heart was strong enough for surgery. During this test, she collapsed. They believed she'd had a heart attack and recommended angiography to evaluate the damage. During the angiography, they discovered the damage was worse than they though and she needed a coronary artery bypass graft. They took her in for that surgery and she survived.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nShe and some of her friends from the nursing home, including [[Lulu]] and Paula, are in a bowling league together called the Gutter Girlz. Lulu says the league is the only thing that keeps them from rotting in front of the TV like some of the other residents.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
