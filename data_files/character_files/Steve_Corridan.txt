When they arrived, he told them that [[Eric Young]], Brian's father, hadn't signed the donor consent because he was having trouble accepting that his son was gone. April and Jackson reviewed his tests and scans and then talked to Eric themselves. He initially refused to donate Brian's organs, but after Jackson talked to him, he agreed to donate. Despite this, the transplant didn't go forward because they found a lesion in Brian's throat.\n\nWhen Jackson had the idea instead to used her intestine to build her a new throat, Steve rejected the idea, but Jackson said he could do it and because he was an Avery, he didn't need their approval. The operation went forward and Steve scrubbed in to help.\n\n==Career==\nCorridan is an [[Attending|attending]] [[Surgery|surgeon]] and the Chief of Surgery at [[Avery Medical Center--Bozeman]].\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
