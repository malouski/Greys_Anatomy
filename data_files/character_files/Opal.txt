Cindy had some  abdominal pain, which Andrew diagnosed as a hernia. Andrew was immediately suspicious of the fact that Opal did all the talking while Cindy just stood there. He shared his concerns with [[Nurse Liv]] and asked her to get Bailey for him. Meanwhile, he ran additional tests to keep Opal and Cindy in the clinic. Bailey came down to the clinic, but doubted Andrew's claims. She went to check on Cindy herself and didn't detect anything unusual in their reactions, so she told Andrew to treat Cindy and let it go. Despite this, he persisted. He promised Cindy a spot in Meredith's pro bono surgery day for her hernia and used that as an excuse to get Cindy away. He then questioned her, but she revealed nothing and Opal quickly discovered them. A crowd gathered and they tried to talk Andrew down, even as he continued to call for security to arrest Opal. They eventually got Andrew to leave the area and Opal and Cindy embraced. However, later, Opal dragged Cindy out of the hospital by her arm, saying she must have said something to the doctor to tip him off, though Cindy swore she didn't. ''(\"[[Give a Little Bit]]\")''\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Cindy, really named [[Erin Banks]], got sicker, so Opal dropped her off on the side of the road, proclaiming her useless. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nOpal returned to the hospital when [[Robert Corson|Bob Corson]], a fellow human trafficker, was taken to the hospital after two girls he'd taken had set a fire in his basement, leading to him getting burned and having smoke inhalation. She asked after his health while watching them take him inside, but was told nothing. She pretended to have been mugged and hit on the head in order to get inside the hospital, where she broke away from the doctor treating her by pretending to need to use the bathroom. She spoke to someone on the phone, informing them that Bob had had a stroke and that she had to leave the hospital before she was found out. She fled the hospital unknowingly being recognized by [[Andrew DeLuca]]  ''(\"[[No Time for Despair]]\")''\n\nAndrew and Carina followed Opal as she met with a man and gave him money in an envelope. They then followed her to the train station and boarded a train with her. After some time, Opal looked over and saw them. At the next stop, she exited the train and Andrew followed her again. Eventually, police arrived and Opal was arrested, along with a man who had stabbed Andrew as he followed her.
