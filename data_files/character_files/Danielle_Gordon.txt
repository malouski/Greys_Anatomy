She tried to insist that nothing was wrong and she could leave, but the doctors insisted on examining her. During her exam, a gunshot rang out, piercing her abdomen. When they looked at her, Arizona noticed that it was an exit wound and asked if she had put the gun in her vagina, which she confirmed that she had. She was trying to smuggle the gun in to her boyfriend. She was taken into surgery, where the gun was extracted and her abdominal injuries, which were surprisingly minor, were repaired. After surgery, she was arrested, which she said was okay because she'd get to be with her boyfriend, not understanding that that wouldn't happen. Arizona told her she could have more seriously injured herself or someone else and that if she were brave enough to do something like smuggling a gun, she was brave enough to tell her boyfriend no.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe has a boyfriend who is in jail.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 18 at the time of her hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gordon, Danielle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
