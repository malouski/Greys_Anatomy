He was airlifted to the ER, where a CT was ordered for a depressed skull fracture. They decided to leave the hook in until he was in the OR. The CT showed a hematoma and they took him into surgery. Right as they were preparing to remove the hook sloan, Teddy sneezed, causing Owen to jerk the hook and snag an artery. However, they were able to repair the damage. After surgery, he was febrile and so they took him back into surgery with what Teddy believed was a hemothorax where they took the hook out. Derek wanted to get a CT to confirm, but she pushed and he let her take him. Before they could operate, Lexie came into the OR and said she believed he actually had Klebsiella pneumonia like his son. They moved him to the ICU and started antibiotics.\n\nWhen his son came to visit him in the ICU, he told his son that the accident was his own fault, not Doug's.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis son, Doug, works for him on his boat. When he was injured, Doug believed it was his own fault, but after being treated, Walter insisted that it wasn't.\n\n==Career==\nWalter is a crab fisherman, the captain of his own boat. He says he doesn't like it, but it beats not being captain.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 50 at the time of the accident.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x20-14.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Walter}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
