He struggled to move, but Arizona warned him not to try moving, because he could injure himself worse. Arizona was laughing due to shock, but stopped abruptly when Jerry told her that he couldn't feel his legs.\n\nWhen Cristina came back to splint Arizona's leg, she sent Cristina to stabilize Jerry's C-spine. Jerry managed to release his seatbelt while he told Cristina and Arizona that it should be not more than four hours before they were found. Cristina used a board and some tape from the plane to stabilize his head and neck. He instructed her on where to find things and then asked her if he was paralyzed or if he'd walk again. She took a pen and jabbed it into his leg. When he had no reaction, she apologized.\n\nWhile they were out in the woods, Jerry heard a helicopter. He told the doctors to fire the flare gun, but it didn't fire properly and the helicopter left. After the sun set, Jerry said that the transmitter had probably been damaged in the crash, meaning that no one knew where they were.\n\nIt was later confirmed during a meeting about the lawsuit that Jerry is paralyzed.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nAfter spending four days in the woods with Jerry, the doctors bonded with him somewhat and when they were discussing who would be sued, they were firmly opposed to suing Jerry, despite their rep's insistence that they needed to stop seeing Jerry as one of them. ''(\"[[Second Opinion]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nJerry was a pilot for Bayview Aeronautics. He was flying the plane that crashed, resulting in the deaths of [[Lexie Grey]] and [[Mark Sloan]] and the injuries of [[Arizona Robbins]], [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Cristina Yang]], and [[Meredith Grey]]. Since the plane crash rendered him paralyzed, it's safe to assume he had to quit his job.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*In [[Throwing it All Away]], Arizona mentioned Jerry appears in her dreams about the plane crash.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jerry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]"}}}]}}}}
