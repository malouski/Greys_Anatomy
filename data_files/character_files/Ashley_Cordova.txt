During the hearing, she questioned multiple witnesses and the court learned that Schmitt had been the one to turn her in, thinking that Ellis's name on Gabby's wristband was a mistake. She also questioned Andrew about their relationship and his aborted decision to leave Grey Sloan after Alex beat him up. When they got to Alex, she asked him about the adoption nearly falling through. Alex didn't want to answer, but [[Paul Castello]] pushed him, causing Meredith to snap and reveal to Paul who she was and how his actions had affected her life and the lives of her children. While they talked about suspending the trial until they could work out the conflict of interest, Paul collapsed and started seizing. They wanted to reschedule her hearing after Paul was taken the hospital, but Alex brought in a group of Meredith's former patients who came in to talk about how Meredith saved their lives and how her losing her medical license would be a loss for the community. Alex then read a letter from Cristina and said he had several others. The two remaining commission members voted that Meredith should keep her license, rendering Paul's vote irrelevant.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a prosecutor.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Getting questioned by her has been compared to ripping ten hangnails off at once.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x08-17.jpg\n16x08-19.jpg\n16x08-24.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cordova, Ashley}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
