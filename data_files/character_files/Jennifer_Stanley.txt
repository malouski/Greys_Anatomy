Due to the unknown complication that lead to Mary's permanent coma and subsequent multiple organ failure after her standard colostomy reversal, [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Miranda Bailey]] was anxious to identify the proper cause of death and assisted Dr. Stanley with the autopsy.\n\nAlthough Dr. Bailey wanted to do a specific approach with the autopsy, Dr. Stanley informed her about following the standard methodology, much to her chagrin. As they continued with the autopsy, Dr. Stanley's patience was tested as Dr. Bailey questioned her approach, her assessment on postmortem clots, her decision to take a lunch break, and her refusal to cut into the brain.
