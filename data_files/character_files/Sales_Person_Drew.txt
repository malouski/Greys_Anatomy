She asked Callie if she could help, and Callie replied that she needed just plain pantyhose, which weren't in the pile. Drew tried to offer her fancier options, which made Callie frustrated as she just wanted regular nude pantyhose. Callie started yelling at Drew, but soon realized she was making a mistake doing so. She apologized, and then said she'd take all the different pantyhose from the pile, even the ones with rhinestones.\n\n==Career==\nDrew is a sales associate at a clothing store that Callie visited when she was looking for regular pantyhose.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drew}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Drew}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
