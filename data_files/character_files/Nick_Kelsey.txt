Nick and Phil jumped, but were caught in an avalanche, so Tommy didn't jump. They were taken to the ER, where Nick was found to have a dislocated ankle and fractures to his hip and tibia. He also had frostbite in his fingers. He had fluid around his kidney, so they did a CT. Callie fixed his bones and he had surgery on his kidney.\n\nAfter his surgery, he was told he'd need six months of physical therapy. [[Callie Torres]] then revealed to Nick and Phil that Tommy didn't enjoy their trips, which led to all of them admitting that they don't need them to keep their blood pumping anymore. So they agreed to go wine tasting in Napa instead of going to run with the bulls in Pamplona.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe's married to a woman named Lainey. When Nick had to have surgery, Tommy called his wife to have her talk to Lainey because she can handle Lainey better.\n\n===Friendships===\nNick, [[Phil]], and [[Tommy]] are best friends. They went on several trips to keep their blood pumping, each not realizing that the others didn't need the trips.\n\n==Career==\nHe sells insurance.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 32 at the time of the accident.\n*They'd previously climbed Kilimanjaro.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kelsey, Nick}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
