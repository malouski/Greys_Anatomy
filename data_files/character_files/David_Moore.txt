When asked what a while was, he joked, \"Until one of us dies or your leg grows back.\" When she didn't react, he said that that joke is always a risk. He noted that her residual limb didn't have scar tissue and was healing well.\n\nHe made a cast of her residual limb and then put her in a basic prosthetic leg. When she refused to let him see her put weight on it, he left her alone in the room. He later returned to see her standing in front of a mirror on the prosthetic. She finally told him where the leg didn't fit correctly and he said they'd work on that.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nDavid has a brother whom he says never checks his phone messages, a trait that David finds maddening.\n\n===Professional===\n====[[Arizona Robbins]]====\nFollowing the amputation of her left leg above the knee, Arizona began working with David to regain her mobility through the use of [[Prosthesis|prosthetics]]. He quickly tried to establish a good relationship with her, saying they'd be working together until one of them died or her leg grew back.\n\n==Career==\nDavid Moore is a [[Prosthesis|prosthetist]] at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*After\u00a0[[Travis Reed]]\u00a0lost both his legs, Callie gave him information on support groups and an incredible prosthetist. As she was talking out of experience with Arizona, it's likely that she was talking about David.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moore, David}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Support Staff]]"}}}]}}}}
