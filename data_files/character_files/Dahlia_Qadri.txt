She believes patient connection is as important as surgical dexterity. She likes to bond with patients over an anecdote. ''(\"[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head]]\")''\n\n===New Intern Mixer===\nDahlia attended the new intern mixer at the hospital, where Richard gave a speech about them starting their work as doctors. During the party, Meredith Grey was celebrated as she learned she had been nominated for a [[Catherine Fox Award|Harper Avery Award]]. The new interns then walked around the hospital, in awe that they worked there and so did Meredith Grey. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\n===Hospital Hacking===\nWhen the hospital was hacked, the doctors had to resort to using old school methods to diagnose and treat patients. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\n===Helping Jackson===\nDahlia worked with Jackson developing his proposal for the surgical contest. When Catherine approached her about another project she wanted Jackson to work on, Dahlia wrote both proposals and told Jackson she liked the other one. She wrote both proposals in under 3 days total, which meant that in order to accomplish this, she didn't sleep at all during that time. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\n===Tyler Richardson===\nWhen [[Tyler Richardson]] was brought in with a chunk of metal in his leg, Dahlia was charged with escorting him to the CT. On the way, he woke up and pulled the metal of his leg, causing profuse bleeding. Thinking quickly, Dahlia pulled off her hijab and used it to slow the bleeding, saving Tyler's life. Later, while scrubbing in for the OR, Owen was suprised that she had removed her hijab and she replied that her hijab is \"a symbol of [her] faith, but [her] faith is about service and compassion.\" She scrubbed in on the surgery, which Tyler survived. Later, Owen returned her hijab to her, after having it washed. ''(\"[[You Really Got a Hold on Me]]\")''\n\n===Trauma Certification===\nThe time came for the interns to go through their Trauma Certification Drill. Owen set the scenario where a Cessna crashed into a Greyhound bus. April interrupted and said that the evacuation helicopter wasn't coming and people were dying. Their job was to save lives. Owen judged the competition, but April hung around to help and insistently made the scenarios worse. She even had a second plane crash hit Andrew, who was helping monitor. She also added rain with a hose. The difficulties ended when April was paged away. Owen helped the interns calm down and continued the drill. When April returned, she learned that Casey had been the one to page her away. He realized that she was endangering the patients the most, so he removed her from the equation. She told him he was trying to cheat and after she \"cheated\" at her certification, a man came into the hospital and died because she couldn't save him. She then started crying and performing CPR on a dummy while the interns watched. Andrew stopped her and she said the certification was done. ''(\"[[Caught Somewhere in Time]]\")''\n\n===Contest===\nAfter several of the doctors ingested weed cookies, Meredith told the interns they'd have to step up more and told them to keep track of what they did and whoever did the most would win a contest and get to scrub in with her on a Whipple. ''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\n===Saving April===\nAfter April was in a car accident and came to the hospital hypothermic, Dahlia and the other interns took shifts with the attendings doing CPR. ''(\"[[Cold as Ice]]\")''\n\n===Alex and Jo's Wedding===\nOn the day of Alex and Jo's wedding, Dahlia was part of the group that went to the wrong wedding. When they realized what had happened, they all rushed to get on a ferry out to Bainbridge Island. Despite a series of delays, Jo and Alex eventually got married on the ferry, witnessed by their friends. ''(\"[[All of Me]]\")''\n\n===Motorcycle Crash===\nDahlia helped treat [[Cheryl Giles]] after she and her husband crashed a motorcycle. After the dog they served to avoid hitting got loose in the ER, Dahlia was sent to chase it down. She caught it, but when Cheryl said they couldn't keep the dog, her son let it loose again. Dahlia chased the dog down again, but couldn't catch it. However, when she gave up and sat down, the dog jumped up next to her. She ended up taking the dog home. ''(\"[[Broken Together]]\")''\n\n===[[Julius Guerra]]===\nJulius came into the hospital with trouble breathing after an apartment fire. They did an x-ray, which showed a pulmonary bleb. He'd had it since he was a child and didn't want it removed because he couldn't afford the surgery. Because he had so much difficulty breathing, Alex didn't want to let him leave without having the bleb removed and nicked Julius with a scalpel to make an excuse to take him into surgery. Dahlia saw what he did and said she'd have to report him. She did, but when Julius woke up, he was relieved that it was gone and knew his mother would be happy as well. ''(\"[[Momma Knows Best]]\")''\n\n===Wind Storm===\nDuring the wind storm, Dahlia helped treat [[Georgia]], who was impaled with shards of glass. She also scrubbed in on her surgery. ''(\"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\")''\n\nAfter the power came back, Cece was waiting in the OR for her transplant. Dahlia monitored her and was sent to find out how much time it would be before the organs were ready and found that the procurement hadn't started yet. After the transplant started, Dahlia assisted. Cece ultimately died during the surgery. ''(\"[[Shelter from the Storm]]\")''\n\n===Working with Meredith===\nDahlia was on Meredith's service and helped develop a treatment plan for her patients. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\n===Mass Overdose===\nWhen a flood of patients came into the ER with opioid overdoses, Dahlia treated a patient with a shooter's abscess and got a lesson in schooling her facial features. Later, when [[Ralph Tennyson]] came into the ER with lesions all over his feet, Dahlia debrided them and bandaged them. ''(\"[[I Want a New Drug]]\")''\n\n===Skinning Fish===\nJackson was treating Rick, who had been burned over a large portion of his body. He decided to use fish skin to graft the burns and had the interns skin the fish. When Richard learned the rest of the fish was being put in medical waste, he decided to host a fish fry and invited the interns. ''(\"[[And Dream of Sheep]]\")''\n\n===Math with Nora===\nAfter being beat to the answer of a math problem with an 11 year old, Dahlia had Casey and then the other interns, plus Maggie and Bailey, come in and have a contest to see who could do the math the fastest on a series of problems. ''(\"[[Add It Up]]\")''\n\n===Abby Redding===\nWhen [[Abby Redding]] came into the ER after being attacked and assaulted, Dahlia was on the case. She helped examine Abby and collect evidence after she agreed. When Abby needed surgery, Dahlia helped coordinate all the women of the hospital coming together to line the halls so she wouldn't have to see the faces of any men. ''(\"[[Silent All These Years]]\")''\n\n===ER Work===\nDahlia was working in the ER on [[Avi Styron]], who was in abdominal pain and waiting for a CT when [[Gemma Larson]] came in when a shoe impaled in her chest. Avi agreed that Dahlia should tend to her first. ''(\"[[Head Over High Heels]]\")''\n\n===Kari Donnelly===\nThirteen days after Kari's stem cell transfusion, Dahlia was charged with monitoring her and tracking her progress. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nWhen Kari's finger twitched, Dahlia helped monitor her to see if it would happen again. When she squeezed Toby's hand unconsciously, Dahlia said she'd seen it. She was also there to celebrate when Kari moved her hand again, more purposefully. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n===Jai Prishna===\nDahlia worked on the case of [[Jai Prishna]], who had fallen off a cliff and hung there for hours. She was present when he finally woke up after falling into a coma following a stroke. ''(\"[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\")''\n\n===Skills Lab===\nWanting to find her joy again, Bailey set up a skills lab based around the case of [[Wade Foltz]]. She challenged the residents to determine his diagnosis and then practice their surgical skills for the chance to do a portion of the surgery. Dahlia incorrectly answered Bailey's question about the hardest part of the axillary-bifemoral bypass procedure, earning her a week of rectal exam assignments. Dahlia participated in the lab, but lost the skills challenge to Taryn. ''(\"[[Back in the Saddle]]\")''\n\n===Getting Fired===\nDahlia worked with Jo on the case of [[Shirley Gregory]], who had been a patient of Meredith's. When Shirley refused to let anyone other than Meredith work on her, Jo had the idea to have Meredith video conference in to assist. After the surgery, Dahlia cried in the hallway. When Bailey found her, Dahlia explained that she had come to Grey Sloan to learn from Meredith and knew many other residents had as well. She was upset that Bailey had just fired her. Bailey then said she could have something in common with Meredith and said Dahlia was fired as well. ''(\"[[Reunited]]\")''\n\nShe found a job in Michigan. ''(\"[[It's Raining Men]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe has a crush on [[Jackson Avery]]. She thinks he is talented and attractive. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nShe was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] until she was fired after telling Bailey that she came to the hospital, as did many other residents, to learn from Meredith Grey. She re-matched to a hospital in Michigan.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She is the first prominent character to wear a hijab on the show.
