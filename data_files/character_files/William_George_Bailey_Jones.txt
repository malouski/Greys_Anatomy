[[George O'Malley]] helped coach Bailey through her labor, and she thanked him by naming her son William George Bailey Jones (although he is nicknamed \"Tuck\" for his father). ''(\"[[As We Know It]]\")''\n\n===Infancy===\nWhen Tuck was still very young, his mother brought him into the hospital with her. She took him into an OR gallery, where they observed part of [[Jake Burton|Jake Burton's]] surgery. She took him out of the gallery when Jake coded. ''(\"[[Yesterday]]\")''\n\nOnce her maternity leave ended, she had to bring Tuck into the hospital with her because the nursery was full and Tucker was out of town. When she got paged into surgery, she had Cristina babysit him. ''(\"[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\")''\n\nTucker took a year off work so that he could take care of Tuck at home. Miranda always felt bad about not having enough time to spend with him so she started to call them from the hospital, once making a late-night call to sing \"God Bless the Child\" to him. ''(\"[[Staring at the Sun]]\")''\n\nOnce, he flooded his house after sticking a toy down the toilet.\n\n===Accident===\n[[File:BabyTuck.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Baby Tuck]]\nOne day, Tuck went to his mother's office in search of her and a bookshelf fell on him. Tuck was rushed to the ER so they could assess his injuries. They ran a full trauma panel and took him for a CT. The CT revealed that his stomach was in his chest and his colon was ruptured. They took him into surgery. When Bailey came into the OR while they were operating, Erica stopped and refused to continue until Bailey left. In order to get her to leave, Cristina agreed to hold Tuck's hand. The surgery was successful, but there was still fluid in his chest, so they didn't know how soon he'd be able to breathe on his own. Desperate to help her son, Bailey invited a faith healer, [[Elizabeth Archer]], to do a healing ritual on Tuck. Afterward, he started breathing on his own and was able to be extubated. ''(\"[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]\")''\n\n===Conflict at Day Care===\nWhen he was fourteen months old, he punched someone in his day care named Harrison over a graham cracker. Bailey had to bribe the director to keep Tuck there with medical perks for some of the staff and supplying fruit slices. Tucker told her it had happened numerous times before. ''(\"[[Losing My Mind]]\")''\n\n===Visiting His Grandparents===\nAfter the hospital shooting, Tuck went with his mother to see his grandparents for a month. ''(\"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\")''\n\n===Disappearance From Day Care===\nWhile his mom was treating [[Holly Wheeler]], a kidnapping victim, she came to collect Tuck from the hospital daycare to find he was not there. She had been deeply disturbed by the circumstances under which Holly had been abducted from the street by her kidnapper and she jumped to the conclusion that the same had happened to Tuck. It turned out that he had been taken to see a nurse as he had a nose bleed and was reunited with Miranda just after she insisted that another teacher call a 'Code Pink'. ''(\"[[The Girl with No Name]]\")''\n\n===Mother's Wedding===\nTuck attended his mother's wedding to [[Ben Warren]]. ''(\"[[Things We Said Today]]\")''\n\n===Halloween===\nTuck told Ben he wanted to be a mad scientist for Halloween, so Ben spent a lot of time helping him create the perfect costume and the two of them decorated the house to look like his lab. ''(\"[[Thriller]]\")''\n\n===Amusement Park Visit===\nHis mother and Ben took him to an amusement park. He was an inch too short to ride one of the rides, so he tried to scam the ticket taker. He wanted to stuff his shoes with his socks to make himself look taller. He threw a fit when his mom wouldn't let him. ''(\"[[You're Gonna Need Someone on Your Side]]\")''\n\n===School Fight===\nTuck was sent home from school after punching a kid in his class. Bailey let him sit in her office, not wanting to bring the hammer down on him after spending all day doing so with her employees. Ben convinced her to tap him in and he used a \"scare straight\" attempt, showing Tuck [[Andrew DeLuca|Andrew's]] scans and lying to say that Andrew was blind in one eye and Alex was in jail for punching him. It was effective and Tuck handed his phone over to his mother for two weeks and promised to apologize to the kid and never do it again. ''(\"[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]]\")''\n\n===Maggie's Science Camp===\nDuring a teacher work day, Tuck and his friend, [[Rocco]], didn't have school, so they came to the hospital. Ben was supposed to sign Tuck up for Science Camp, but he forgot, so Maggie offered to do a science camp with the kids instead. They enjoyed the science she showed them and asked how she did it. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n===The Talk===\nAfter treating [[Eric Sterling]], Ben and Bailey knew it was time to give Tuck The Talk. They taught him how, as a Black person, to deal with interactions with the police, telling him to be polite and respectful, even when others aren't. They told him his only job was to make it home safe at the end of the day, so he could become everything he wanted to be. ''(\"[[Personal Jesus]]\")''\n\n===History Presentation===\nTuck had a history presentation to give at school, so he got dressed up. He was embarrassed by his mother taking a picture of him on the drive to school because his tie wasn't straight. He later told his mother the presentation went well and he got a standing ovation from all the teachers. ''(\"[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\")''\n\n===Fire Alarm===\nTuck pulled the fire alarm at his school to get Ben there as quickly as possible with no questions. He needed Ben's help because his friend [[Ava Linsley]] was in labor. Tuck then helped Ben and Vic deliver Ava's baby. To keep Tuck from getting in trouble, Ben told him to turn his sweatshirt inside out and cleaned his hands with a wipe so no one would know he had pulled the alarm. ''(\"[[Invisible to Me]]\")''\n\n===Dia De Los Muertos===\nOn Dia De Los Muertos, Tuck decorated a sugar skull and told his mom about the day. ''(\"[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\")''\n\n===Learning Consent===\nAfter learning that Tuck was \"talking to\" a girl, Ben and Bailey decided they needed to talk to him about dating and consent and condoms. Ben offered to do it as his father had done for him. He took Tuck for burgers and explained to him that consent is necessary and if at any point, anyone he's with isn't having fun, everything stops. ''(\"[[Silent All These Years]]\")''\n\n===Station Visit===\nTuck visited Ben at the station and had a meal with him and the rest of the team. When Tuck left abruptly, Ben tried to stop him, but Tuck called him out on not having much time for them lately because of his Medic One training. At the end of the day, while driving Tuck home, he told him the story of what happened with [[Elliot (The Dark Night)|Elliot]] and his daughter. Tuck agreed that it really sucked. Inspired by Elliot, however, Ben decided to spend the night outside with Tuck looking at the stars. ''(\"[[The Dark Night]]\")''\n\n===Joey Phillips===\nWhen [[Joey Phillips]] was discharged without anywhere to go, Bailey took him to her house, where he played video games with Tuck. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\n===Playing Basketball===\nBen came home after a long shift to find Joey and Tuck playing basketball together. He then joined their game. ''(\"[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\")''\n\n===Spaghetti Fundraiser===\nTuck and Joey came with Bailey to the spaghetti dinner fundraiser to help raise money for Pruitt's funeral. They ate voraciously, then discussed their mutual desire to go down the fire pole, which Ben said they couldn't do. When they cleared their plates, they asked if they could go get more, which Ben said they could. ''(\"[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\")''\n\n===Covid-19===\nAt the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Ben's sister Rosalind came to live at her brother's house to watch Tuck and Joey while Ben and Bailey both quarantined due to their work. Both boys enjoyed this change and wanted Rosalind to continue to stay with them. Rosalind brought them down to the hospital one evening to clap for the healthcare workers at the hospital along with the firefighters of station 19. ''(\"[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\")'' ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\n===Tiger Escape===\nWhen [[Lorelei]] the tiger escaped into Seattle and was eventually trapped in the barn at station 19, Tuck and Joey FaceTimed Ben so they could see her. ''(\"[[Wild World]]\")''\n\n===Grandmother's Death===\nBen came home one day after living at the station since the start of the pandemic. He said he'd tested negative for the virus, but then told them that Bailey's mother had died. Tuck lashed out at him, saying Ben wasn't his dad, before fleeing to his room and refusing to speak to anyone. Ben drew him out of his room by cooking spaghetti. Tuck apologized and asked him how he and his mom deal with seeing people die so often. Ben explained that while sometimes they could only do damage control, sometimes, they're the answer to someone's prayers. And helping that person can do more than save a life. They can restore someone's faith, which strengthens his own. He then said they'd get through this by showing up for each other. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\n===Seattle Protests===\nAfter the death of George Floyd, protests cropped around the country, including many in Seattle. Joey and Tuck asked Ben if they could join the protests, saying they wanted to march for themselves and for Rosalind. Ben finally agreed and they marched along the rest of Station 19. ''(\"[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station 19)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis parents tried to conceive for ten years unsuccessfully when his mother was surprised to find she was pregnant.\n\nHis parents then divorced when he was three. By a few years later, his parents had both remarried. He gets along really well with his stepfather\u00a0[[Ben Warren]]\u00a0and even calls him dad.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe is friends with [[Ava Linsley]] and they are in debate club together. ''(\"[[Invisible to Me]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*George had a very close relationship to Tuck, as a result of him supporting Miranda during labor. He offered himself to take care of Tuck or entertain him whenever Tucker and Miranda were about to have a fight in the hospital.\n*Tuck dressed as a mad doctor for [[Thriller|Halloween]].\n*He plays the French horn. He was terrible at it at first, but Bailey didn't allow him to quit, and now he's first chair.<ref>[[Sledgehammer]], 12x01</ref>\n*He's in the school debate club.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], 1x02 (S19)</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x17WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[As We Know It]]\n2x18WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Yesterday]]\n2x19WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]\n2x20WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole]]\n409Tuck.png|[[Crash Into Me, Part 1]]\n4x11WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Lay Your Hands on Me]]\n4x12WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Where the Wild Things Are]]\n414Tuck.png|[[The Becoming]]\n4x15WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Losing My Mind]]\n4x17WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Freedom, Part 2]]\n5x14WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Beat Your Heart Out]]\n6x19WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Sympathy for the Parents]]\n701Tuck.png|[[With You I'm Born Again]]\n820Tuck.png|[[The Girl with No Name]]\n9x10WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Things We Said Today]]\n10x07WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Thriller]]\n13x03WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[I Ain't No Miracle Worker]]\n14x10WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Personal Jesus]]\n14x11WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\nS191x02WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Invisible to Me]]\n15x06WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\n15x19WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Silent All These Years]]\nS192x13WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[The Dark Night]]\n16x15WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Snowblind]]\n16x16WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Leave a Light On]]\nS193x10WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Something About What Happens When We Talk]]\nS193x14WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[The Ghosts That Haunt Me]]\nS194x01WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Nothing Seems the Same]]\n17x01WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\nS194x02WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Wild World]]\nS194x05TuckJones.png|[[Out of Control]]\nS194x12WilliamGeorgeBaileyJones.png|[[Get Up, Stand Up (Station 19)|Get Up, Stand Up]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nS192x13-9.jpg\nS192x13-12.jpg\nS192x13-13.jpg\nS192x13-15.jpg\nS192x13-16.jpg\nS192x13-17.jpg\n16x16-8.jpg\nS193x14-23.jpg\nS193x14-25.jpg\nS193x14-26.jpg\nS194x12-8.jpg\nS194x12-15.jpg\nS194x12-16.jpg\nS194x12-17.jpg\nS194x12-18.jpg\nS194x12-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{William George Bailey Jones Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:William George Bailey Jones]]\n[[es:William George Bailey Jones]]\n[[fr:William George Bailey Jones]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, William George Bailey}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
