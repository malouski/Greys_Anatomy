Link said previous meals always devolved into the two them comparing their lives to determine who had a better one since the divorce, but he had high hopes for this one because he and Amelia could tell them they're going to be grandparents. At the lunch, Maureen said she was getting remarried to Eric. He'd moved to Denver for work and joined a dating app to meet people. Maureen was his first match, so he moved to a different app. Two more apps also paired them, so they decided to get coffee and rekindled their relationship. Link was angry because they put him through the wringer getting divorced and always put him between them and now they've worked it out. He told them about the pregnancy and when they were discussing timing of the baby, they noted that they had put a deposit down on a wedding venue, but when that upset Link even more, they said they could change it.\n\n===Wedding and Visiting Link===\nDespite the [[COVID-19 Pandemic]], Eric and Maureen decided to go forward with their wedding, making their son fearful that they'd get COVID. ''(\"[[It's All Too Much]]\")''\n\nLater, Eric and Maureen bought an RV, packed it with supplies, and drove it from Colorado to Seattle. For two weeks, they had no contact with anyone but each other. When they arrived in Seattle, they were excited to meet Scout and offered to take all four kids to see Mt. Rainier so Amelia and Link could have some time to themselves. ''(\"[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is currently engaged to his ex-wife, Maureen. They had a contentious divorce and made their\u00a0son go between them when he was just a child. However, after being apart, they were matched on three different dating websites and decided to get coffee. Things went well between them and they decided to get re-married.\n\n===Familial===\nHe and Maureen have one son, Link.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x06EricLincoln.png|[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\n17x11EricLincoln.png|[[Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Eric Lincoln Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lincoln, Eric}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
