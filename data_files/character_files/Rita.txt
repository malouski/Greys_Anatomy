Arizona disagreed and believed he should have been sedated and ventilated as he waited. Two weeks later, when Riley disconnected the lead to the artificial lung, Callie said they needed to take him back into the OR to hook it back up. However, Arizona objected, saying that he should be put back on ECMO instead. Then Callie noticed that Riley's oxygen levels were higher than they had previously been and he was breathing well. Callie said they needed to run more tests, but it was possible that Riley would no longer require a transplant.\n\nThey ran the tests and confirmed that he would no longer need a transplant and would be able to go home later in the week.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nRita's son, Riley, was in the hospital on an artificial lung. When she found out that because of the artificial lung, he might not need a transplant anymore, she was overjoyed.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
