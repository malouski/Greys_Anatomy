He had ascending paralysis. His spinal x-rays were clear. He said the fall was small. Derek ordered an MRI. His films were all clear, but his paralysis continued to worsen. Meredith started to suspect that it was a psychosomatic reaction, but Derek assured him that they'd figure it out. The paralysis then extended to his upper limbs, so Derek took him into surgery, suspecting a clot in his upper spine that the scans had missed. After more than four hours, they finally found a clot and evacuated it.\n\nAfter the surgery, Tommy slowly started to regain feeling in his lower body. He was even able to move one of his fingers.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Tommy Walker]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband have two sons.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walker, Ruby}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
