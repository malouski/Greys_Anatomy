Meredith informed her that the baby had a murmur, which Elizabeth already knew. She claimed it was a benign murmur and would go away with age. However, Meredith went to the parents and got them to pressure the doctors to make sure that was an accurate diagnosis. Elizabeth went to her boss about it, but when [[Preston Burke|Dr. Burke]] stepped in, the tests were run and it was discovered that the baby had a serious heart defect and needed surgery. Elizabeth later talked to Meredith and cleared the air with her. ''(\"[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]\")''\n\n===Severed Arm===\nWhile everyone was on edge because of the hospital merger, Elizabeth made a mistake in surgery, accidentally nearly severing a baby's arm during a c-section. ''(\"[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\")''\n\n===Sloan's Baby===\nWhen Lexie saw something suspicious on Sloan's ultrasound, she took her up to OB, where Elizabeth used a stronger machine and noted swelling of one of the baby's feet, due to bands of amniotic tissue wrapped around his legs. Mark kicked her off the case when she said she didn't know if they could fix it. ''(\"[[Blink]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nElizabeth is a [[Board Certification|board certified]] [[Attending|attending surgeon]] in the [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] department at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]]. When everyone was on edge due to the impending merger, she accidentally nearly severed the arm of a baby girl during a C-Section.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*On her [[The First Cut Is the Deepest|premier episode]], Elizabeth is not named and is credited as \"Peds Intern\".\n*Although Elizabeth began her [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] [[Resident|residency]] at the same time as [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] and the original interns, Elizabeth is already an [[Attending|attending]] by [[Blink|season 6]], while Meredith is only in her third year of residency. This is an inconsistency/timeline-error as she would've also been a third-year OB/GYN resident.\n*Although not stated in dialogue, Elizabeth is [[Board Certification|board certified]] in [[Obstetrics and Gynecology|OB/GYN]] as her lab coat confirms her designation of [[Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|FACOG]], which requires board certification for membership.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n102ElizabethChen.png|[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]\n6x03ElizabethChen.png|[[I Always Feel Like Somebody's Watchin' Me]]\n6x11ElizabethChen.png|[[Blink]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Elizabeth Chen Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chen, Elizabeth}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
