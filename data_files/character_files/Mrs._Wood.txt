Addison planned an EXIT surgery. They removed the baby partially to operate because the tumor was obstructing her airway. That would allow her to keep getting oxygen through the umbilical cord while they removed the tumor.\n\nWhile Cheyenne was waiting for her surgery, she was reading Shakespeare to the baby. Izzie talked to her and suggested adoption as an option to her, knowing that it's not something that's discussed where they come from. When Mrs. Wood found out, she was upset and confronted Izzie, who defended herself, saying that Mrs. Wood should want more for her daughter than what she has.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe has a daughter. When she felt that [[Izzie Stevens]] was crossing a line with her daughter, she confronted her.\n\n==Career==\nShe works graveyard shifts as a waitress in a diner in Chehalis.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wood, Mrs.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
