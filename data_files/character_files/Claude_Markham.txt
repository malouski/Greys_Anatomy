They did a cardiac workup, but then Claude had trouble breathing due to ARDS. They intubated him and then decided to put him on ECMO. Because of the hack and the possibility that technology might fail, they decided to move Claude to another hospital. They loaded him into a helicopter. On the way, his tube came out, spraying blood everywhere. ''(\"[[Out of Nowhere]]\")''\n\nThey were able to stop the bleeding and got him to the alternate hospital. He was unstable, so they had to rush him into surgery immediately. They put him back on ECMO and he was stable afterwards.
