Jo examined her internally and extracted a strawberry from her vaginal canal. Robin asked if that would explain the pain in her abdomen, but Jo said it shouldn't. She then told the doctors that she'd become distracted while doing a ritual she saw on social media to bring love and healing to her life and inserted the strawberry she was meant to have eaten and eaten the yoni egg she was meant to have inserted. She then had surgery to remove the yoni egg, which had caused an intestinal obstruction. The surgery was successful.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Whistling calms her nerves.\n*She was 23 at the time of her surgery.\n*Her surgery was [[Levi Schmitt|Levi Schmitt's]] first solo surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jeter, Robin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
