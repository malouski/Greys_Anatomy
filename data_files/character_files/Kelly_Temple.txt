In the ER, they found that Nancy was having a heart attack and rushed her to the cath lab. Because her father was back in Miami, Kelly stayed with [[Cristina Yang]]. Kelly wanted to know if her mom would be okay, but Cristina admitted that she didn't know. But she did know that Kelly was scared and explained that when she was Kelly's age, she and her dad were in an accident and he was hurt and she was scared. She also lied and told Kelly that her father was okay.\n\nWhile they were playing a card game, Kelly asked Cristina what would happen if her mom died. She told Kelly they'd talk about it if it happened, but when Jackson signaled to her that Nancy had died, she said she'd feel a lot of things, but over time, it would hurt less and less and eventually, it would only hurt a little.\n\nSocial services took over and put her to bed in a patient room. Her dad was supposed to be there by the time she woke up.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer mother died while they were on a trip to Seattle.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was nine at the time of her mother's death.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x21-5.jpg\n6x21-21.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Temple, Kelly}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
