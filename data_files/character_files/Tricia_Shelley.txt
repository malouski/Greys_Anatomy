Because of this, they decided to get prophylactic gastrectomies.\n\nMegan and Mike backed out of the surgery after hearing the side effects, but Tricia went ahead with hers. When they found stage I gastric cancer in Tricia's surgery, which they believed would be curative, that convinced Megan to have the surgery. However, Mike still refused. After their surgeries, Tricia and Megan agreed that the pain wasn't too bad. Tricia also pledged to keep on Mike until he had the surgery, saying you don't leave the people you love alone.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nDue to the gastric cancer gene running in their family, the Shelley family was down to a branch. They had lost their mother, grandfather, aunt, and uncle to the disease and had a cousin in hospice care.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 31 at the time of her gastrectomy.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shelley, Tricia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Genetics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
