During her interview, they were surprised she'd never run a department on her own, but had rather assisted the department head, but she defended that Bailey had never been chief until she was. The interview was interrupted when Richard came in and asked Michelle to scrub in on an emergency surgery on [[Brad DiMarco]], who had injured his face when a firework went off. They continued the interview in the OR, as she said she thinks more clearly in there. In the surgery, she became inpatient with Levi when she had to ask multiple times for instruments.\n\nAfter she completed the surgery, Bailey officially offered her the job, but she turned it down, saying their residents weren't at the level she required, as she heavily depended on residents in her work. Richard said that happened because the pandemic stole an entire year from them and he promised he would catch them up. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nDespite her resistance, Michelle took the job at Grey Sloan. During the heat wave, she treated [[Chet]], who had burned his butt and upper thighs on the hot sidewalk while filming a video for social media. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nAt her former hospital, she served as the [[Attending#Department Head|assistant head]] of [[Plastic Surgery|plastics]]. She described her previous head of plastics as a man who enjoys vacation homes and only hired women because he was obligated. Some time before that, she completed her [[Resident|residency]] in [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngology]] at NYU, where her mentor, Dr. Joyce Wu, taught her how to use an 18-gauge needle to differentiate between living and dead tissue, even in the most extreme of cases. She then went on to complete a [[Fellow|plastics fellowship]].\n\nWhen she manages residents as an attending, she moves quickly and teaches by doing. Her style of teaching relies on the residents' abilities to keep up as she does not have the time to go through each step in detail nor hold their hands. Given the high-level surgeries in her caseload and practice, she expects her residents to anticipate her next move. \n\nDuring her interview at Grey-Sloan, she was granted surgical privileges by [[Richard Webber|Dr. Webber]] on an emergent plastics case. After her interview, she was offered the head of plastics position, but expressed a concern of the residents' competency given her management style. Despite Dr. Webber committing to fast-track their education, she asked for some time to consider the offer. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nShe eventually accepted the position, and she is currently the Head of Plastic Surgery and an [[Attending|attending]] [[Otolaryngology|ENT surgeon]] at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]]. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She hates northern winters, implying her former place of work is in a northern city that is notable for their winters.\n*Like then [[Attending#Department Head|Head]] of [[Plastic Surgery]] [[Mark Sloan|Dr. Mark Sloan]], her background includes a surgical residency in [[Otolaryngology|ENT]] and a  fellowship in plastics.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n18x01MichelleLin.png|[[Here Comes the Sun]]\n18x03MichelleLin.png|[[Hotter Than Hell]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Michelle Lin Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lin, Michelle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
