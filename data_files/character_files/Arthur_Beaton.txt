During the [[COVID-19 Pandemic|pandemic]], his parents took extra precautions because of his heart, but he still ended up in the hospital in heart failure. He'd been put on ECMO, but after 12 days, he still hadn't had a heart transplant. Desperate to do something to extend his time, Cormac suggested an artificial heart. Maggie rejected the suggestion, saying his chest cavity wasn't large enough to accommodate the cannulas and they'd have to leave his chest open to avoid compressing his other internal organs. Cormac then suggested removing both his ventricles, giving them the extra space they needed. His father, Chris, consented to the surgery, so they proceeded. After surgery, Arthur was stable and waiting for his new heart.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis mother suffered severe depression while he was hospitalized. She was unable to log into work for several weeks.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 14 months old at the time of his surgery.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x11-10.jpg\n17x11-17.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beaton, Arthur}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
