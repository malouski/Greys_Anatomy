At the consult, she deferred to him to choose a size, which [[Jackson Avery]] saw as a red flag, so instead of scheduling the surgery, he asked her to come back in six weeks, figuring that six weeks was about as long as it would take for her to figure out that the surgery was what he wanted and not what she wanted.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was dating a man who wanted her to have larger breasts. Because of this, she scheduled a consult with a plastic surgeon, who figured out that she was only planning to have the surgery because of her boyfriend.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
