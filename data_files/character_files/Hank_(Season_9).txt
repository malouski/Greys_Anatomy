Within the following seven years, he had gone into end-stage liver disease and developed heart disease. Heart surgery would have caused his liver to fail, so they had to wait until a liver became available to transplant. Both surgeries were planned for the same day, with the valve replacement first and then the liver transplant.\n\nThe flight bringing his liver was delayed by rain, which worried Hank, but Graham believed that everything happened for a reason.\n\nThe liver arrived and was inserted successfully, but when they went to close his chest, Shane noticed some bleeding around the liver. They attempted to stop the bleeding, but Graham started to reject the liver. He was put back on the transplant list, but they were warned that in his condition, he was unlikely to get one. They estimated that he had about a week to live.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHank was married to Graham Cunningham. He was more worried than Graham was about any problems concerning the liver, because he wanted his 30 years with Graham.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He brought gift bags for all the doctors who treated Graham.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Hank}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
