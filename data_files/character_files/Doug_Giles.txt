They had just gone for a ride around the block and Doug swerved to avoid hitting a dog. Their daughter, Wynnie, drove them to the hospital in their van with only a learner's permit. In the ER, they learned that while Cheryl had only cuts and bruises on her hand, Doug had a serious head injury because Cheryl had been wearing the only helmet. She said she didn't even like the motorcycle, but she liked seeing Doug in the garage with it and it stirred up feelings. While her hands were bandaged, Doug was taken into surgery to treat a brain bleed. After his surgery, he was expected to recover fully and said he'd be getting rid of the motorcycle.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Cheryl Giles]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe and Cheryl have two kids: Wynnie and Hank.
