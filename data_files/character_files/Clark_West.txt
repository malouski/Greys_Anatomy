As he was leaving, the meth lab exploded. Clark was injured and taken to the ER.\n\nAs he got a CAT scan, Clark started breathing heavily. He then coded. [[George O'Malley]] was able to resuscitate him. He was told that he had cardiomyopathy from the drug use and internal bleeding, which meant he couldn't leave the hospital, but he was going to go into withdrawal.\n\nAs he went into withdrawal, he told George that he had first taken meth at a party and thought it would be a one-time thing, but it quickly became an addiction. He then coded again and was unable to be resuscitated.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:West, Clark}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
