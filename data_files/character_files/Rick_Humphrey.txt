When Izzie went into his room to do a pre-operative exam, he kicked her out after recognizing her as the model in a lingerie ad he had used as a masturbatory aid. He refused to let her touch him.\n\nWhen a biopsy revealed that the cancer was localized to his prostate, his surgeon planned a radical prostatectomy, giving him a high chance of being completely cured. However, it would involve severing the nerves, including those used to derive sexual pleasure. Izzie, with Bailey's help, convinced Dr. Victor to do a longer surgery that didn't involve severing the nerves, which would allow Rick to have a more normal sex life after his surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Humphrey, Rick}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Urology)]]"}}}]}}}}
