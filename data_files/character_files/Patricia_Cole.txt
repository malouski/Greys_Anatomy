They hadn't been told which kid it was, so they were desperate to find out. Patricia was horrified to learn that it was her son, Brandon. When they saw [[Stacy]], the babysitter, at the hospital, they asked her what happened and she told them that the kids had found Patricia's gun and [[Peter Green|Peter]] had accidentally shot Brandon.\n\nBrandon had no reflexes in his feet, indicating paralysis, so he was taken into surgery. During the surgery, Patricia was offered the choice between a brace to stabilize his back or spinal decompression, both of which could lead to permanent paralysis. She chose the spinal decompression at Amelia's recommendation, but while Amelia was working, they were forced to defibrillate, moving Brandon's body and undoing that work, leaving him paralyzed.\n\nAfter surgery, Patricia and Ron were told that Brandon would have physical and occupational therapy to regain some function, but he'd never walk again.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Ron Cole]].\n\n===Familial===\nHer son, Brandon, was shot by his friend, Peter, using her gun, leaving him paralyzed.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n12x20-25.jpg\n12x20-26.jpg\n12x20-27.jpg\n12x20-28.jpg\n12x20-29.jpg\n12x20-30.jpg\n12x20-31.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cole, Patricia}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
