When the test came back positive, Izzie tried to offer her prenatal vitamins, but she said she needed to have an abortion. Izzie was shocked. She questioned them about that and found out that Sarah had HIV and didn't want to bring a child into the world with HIV.\n\nIzzie told them that they didn't have to abort the pregnancy. Freddie was excited, but Sarah said she wouldn't do it and asked Izzie to schedule the abortion and find them another doctor. Izzie later came back and said she didn't make herself clear. There was a 98% chance her baby would be healthy if she took her medication as she was supposed to. They decided to continue the pregnancy.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Freddie]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was diagnosed with HIV at age 19.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Sarah}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]"}}}]}}}}
