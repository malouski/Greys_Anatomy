He was left pinned under a door, conscious but unable to move. He was extracted and taken to the emergency room at [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]].\n\nIn the ER, Michael had abdominal pain. His abdomen was rigid and they suspected a liver laceration. When a [[Computed Tomography|CT]] confirmed it, he was taken into surgery. While he was in surgery, he became unstable and was feverish. [[Ben Warren]] quickly diagnosed malignant hyperthermia. They iced Michael's body and turned the temperature in the room down and waited for his heart rate to go back down so they could finish his surgery.\n\nHis surgery was completed successfully and post-op, he was awake and alert.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nMichael was on a camping trip with his family when they were in a car accident. His parents and his grandmother died, leaving him and his two sisters, [[Lily Anderson|Lily]] and [[Abby Anderson|Abby]], on their own.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 14 at the time of his parents' deaths.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n8x10-2.png\n8x10-13.jpg\n8x10-16.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, Michael}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
