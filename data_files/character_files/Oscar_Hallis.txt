The primary concern, however, was infection, as he had a large laceration on his leg. Alex went to give him ampicillin, but Jo stopped him, saying that Oscar is allergic to penicillin, which she learned from the markings on his leg, which listed his vitals. They gave him cefazolin instead. They got him a head CT, which was clear, and he regained consciousness. Since the electronic charts were down, they continued documenting his vitals on his body and told him that someone from plastics would come stitch up his leg.\n\nDespite the laceration on his leg, Oscar walked around and ended up sitting by [[Sasha (Season 10)|Sasha's]] bed. She noticed the vitals on his leg and said the handwriting looked like [[Brian (Season 10)|Brian's]], but Oscar wasn't sure.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a first responder who was part of the evacuation efforts following the Super Storm and mudslide.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He wears glasses, which he lost in the storm.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hallis, Oscar}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
