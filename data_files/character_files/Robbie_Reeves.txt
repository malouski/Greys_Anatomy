Bob chased the other car for a while, but hit a median, injuring himself and Robbie. They were taken to the hospital, where Robbie was more interested in talking about how cool the chase was than getting treated. After he was examined and cleared, he talked to his dad before his dad was taken into surgery.\n\nWhile waiting for his mom to arrived, Robbie admitted to Amelia that he was scared in the car. He thought they were going to die. Just then, his mom arrived, but Robbie became confused and was rushed to a CT. His congenital AVM had blown, causing a bleed in his brain. He was taken into surgery, where his brain started to swell. Despite Amelia's best efforts, he died in the OR.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nRobbie's father said that it was unusual for him to want to do anything with his father because he thought everything his father did was uncool.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 12 at the time of his death.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reeves, Robbie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
