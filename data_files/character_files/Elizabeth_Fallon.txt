She'd had radiation to reduce the tumor load.\n\nLiz was later admitted to Seattle Grace Hospital after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and Cristina Yang worked on her case. Many doctors and nurses at the hospital were delighted to see her including [[Richard Webber]] and [[Preston Burke]]. When no surgery was scheduled, however, it became clear to [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] that Fallon had come to die at the hospital. Cristina called a code when she died, despite the DNR and had to be restrained to discontinue resuscitation efforts. After she was gone, several staff members gathered in her room, paying their respects. ''(\"[[No Man's Land]]\")''\n\n===Posthumous History===\n====Meredith's Near-Death Experience====\nLiz appeared to Meredith after she drowned in [[Elliott Bay]]. She, along with the others, tried to get Meredith to admit that she'd stopped fighting to live. When she finally did, they worried it might be too late for her. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nNurse Fallon had a married daughter and a grandchild.\n\n===Friendships===\n====[[Debbie]]====\nLiz was dear friends with Debbie when she worked at the hospital. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nLiz Fallon worked as a scrub nurse for [[Ellis Grey]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]\u00a0for 18 years, about whom she had clear memories. When Meredith visited Fallon to \"send her regards\" from Ellis, Fallon recalled, \"the Ellis Grey I knew never had regards for anyone except Ellis Grey.\" She proclaimed herself \"all work,\" just like Ellis, and surprised [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] by how well she knew her mother. She refused to cut Cristina any slack for being abrupt and feeling tired, telling her, \"I don't feel sorry for you. This is who we are. This is our lives.\"\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 55 at the time of her death.<ref>[[No Man's Land]], 1x03</ref>\n*Elizabeth is the first person Meredith tells about her mother's, Ellis Grey, Alzheimer's.<ref>[[No Man's Land]], 1x03</ref>\n*In \"[[No Man's Land]],\" it is said that she is dying of pancreatic cancer, but in \"[[Some Kind of Miracle]],\" Meredith states Liz died of liver cancer. Since Liz was considering a Whipple procedure, pancreatic cancer is the correct diagnosis, which makes Meredith's statement a blooper.\n*She was possibly religious, as she was seen reading a Bible right before she passed away. Though this may just be because Bibles are commonly placed in hospital rooms.<ref>[[No Man's Land]], 1x03</ref>\n*Her last words were, \"Think of it as a hazing ritual. Welcome.\"<ref>[[No Man's Land]], 1x03</ref>\n*Her time of death was 11:43 as pronounced by [[Cristina Yang]].<ref>[[No Man's Land]], 1x03</ref>\n*She said she worked with Ellis Grey for 18 years,\u00a0but that is\u00a0inconsistent with how long Ellis worked at Seattle Grace.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n104ElizabethFallon.png|[[No Man's Land]]\n317LizFallon.png|[[Some Kind of Miracle]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n104-15.jpg\n3x17-21.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Elizabeth Fallon Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n[[de:Elizabeth Fallon]]\n[[fr:Elizabeth Fallon]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fallon, Elizabeth}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Nurses]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]"}}}]}}}}
