A mass was revealed, which Jodi initially worried was cancer. A [[Computed Tomography|CT]] showed that the mass was a fetus in fetu, a twin that Greg enveloped in the womb.\n\nThat fetus was determined to be the cause of Greg\u2019s pain, so they scheduled surgery to remove it. However, Greg refused consent for the surgery, saying it was rare and special, so he wanted to keep it, an idea that horrified Jodi. Richard convinced him to let them remove it, but offered to let him keep it afterward.\n\nUpon seeing the removed fetus in the tub, Greg screamed and begged them to take it away.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Greg Penderglass]]====\nShe has been married to Greg Penderglass for ten years.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n10x16-6.jpg\n10x16-8.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Penderglass, Jodi}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
