She was mad at him for being tired all the time.\n\nWhile stitching his face, Izzie noticed that one side of his face drooped, so she ordered a CT. The CT showed a brain tumor larger than a baseball, which was causing his lethargy. They planned surgery to remove it that involved pulling his face down and opening his skull.\n\nAfter his surgery, his wife was told he'd be okay.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Marianne Grandy]]. When he slept through their entire vacation, she was upset. She stated her intent to divorce him while he was in the hospital, but later recanted when she found out he had a brain tumor.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grandy, Arnie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
