His nephew, Levi, came to visit him. During this visit, Levi told Saul he was gay and that Nico was his boyfriend. Saul then abruptly died. Levi felt guilty for telling him, believing it had been what killed him. He felt compelled to stay with his body, citing Jewish tradition. When Saul's wife, [[Gertie]], arrived, Levi tried to hand off the duties to her, but she also left after saying a quick goodbye to Saul, saying they agreed the end was the end for them. Levi continued to watch his body until [[Daniel Schwartz]] arrived. Daniel then revealed that he and Saul had been lovers. After sharing some stories, Daniel and Levi worked together to prepare Saul's body.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Gertie]]====\nHe was married to Gertie until his death.\n\n====[[Daniel Schwartz]]====\nConcurrent with his married to Gertie, Saul was in a relationship with Daniel until his death. They kept this relationship under wraps as Saul's family was not accepting of him and Saul himself hated that he was gay.\n\n===Familial===\nHe didn't get along with his sister, Myrna, because she listened to her parents' opinions about who should lie with whom. Despite this, he got along well with Myrna's son Levi. He knew that Levi was gay before Levi came out to him on his deathbed.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
