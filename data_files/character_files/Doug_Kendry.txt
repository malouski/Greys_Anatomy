[[Cristina Yang]] asked him to take off his shoe and sock so she could examine the foot, despite his insistence that he just needed a painkiller. When she noticed that he had type II diabetes, she asked if he'd noticed anything when he examined his feet. He said he noticed that it hurt. When he removed his sock, she saw that he had a large abscess on the heel of his foot.\n\nCristina then had to break the news to him that they had to amputated his foot because the infection was in his bone. He begged her to find other options, but she said that he should have come in sooner because they would have had other options. He said he'd do anything she told him to do in order to save his foot. She did some research, but wasn't able to find another solution, so he was taken into surgery to have his foot amputated.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kendry, Doug}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
