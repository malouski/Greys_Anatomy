That provoked him to start chasing the other driver, which caused an accident. The driver of the other car involved died and Bob and his wife and son were taken to the hospital. Bob had the most serious injuries, which were complicated by his pre-existing liver failure. He was taken into surgery, where they worked to repair the damage, but they determined that he wouldn't survive the surgery without a liver transplant. His son, [[Scott Seibert|Scott]], had been tested and matched as a living donor, but hadn't made a decision. After hearing that his father would die without it, he agreed to donate, but only on the condition that he and his mother would move out and she'd tell the police what had actually happened and about all the abuse in their house. His transplant went well and his surgery was completed.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Lea Seibert]], whom he abuses.\n\n===Familial===\nHis son, Scott, donated a portion of his liver to him. He was initially reluctant to do so because Bob was beating his wife.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 46 at the time of his car accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seibert, Bob}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
