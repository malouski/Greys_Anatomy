He tried to play it off as something minor, but an x-ray revealed that he had put something into his rectum and it had become stuck. When they showed him the scan, he insisted that it was some kind of growth. However, as they took him to surgery, Carina was able to get him to admit that he had put his wife's \"hair stuff\"\u00a0up there. In surgery, they opened him up in order to remove it, but then Richard noticed something strange, so he told Vik to wait. However, Vik had spotted a bleeder and despite Richard's orders, he cauterized it, which started a fire in the OR because the object was actually hair spray. The fire was quickly extinguished and they continued their surgery. However, Barry coded and was unable to be resuscitated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to [[Patty Clemens]] until his death.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 42 at the time of his death.\n*He was pronounced dead at 17:03.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Clemens, Barry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
