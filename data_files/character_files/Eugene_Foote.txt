He'd found it in his grandfather's attic. He pulled the bow across the strings and he was hooked.\n\n===Pacemaker===\nBurke flew down to San Francisco to place a pacemaker in Eugene's chest.\n\nThe pacemaker worked very well, but a year later, he came to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] and requested that [[Preston Burke|Dr. Burke]] remove his pacemaker, which he believed affected his music by changing his rhythm.\n\nBefore he agreed to operate, Burke suggested they try adjusting the settings. Eugene agreed, but his playing was still off. Burke tried to decline doing the surgery, saying removing it was risky because of the scar tissue that had grown around it.\n\nEugene said if Burke wouldn't operate, he'd find someone who would, so Cristina talked him into agreeing, saying this gave him his best chance of survival. They took him into surgery, but despite their best efforts, he died in the OR.\n\n==Career==\nAccording to [[George O'Malley|George]], Foote was a \"genius violinist.\" After getting a pacemaker, he believed that his playing was not as good as before, so he asked Burke to remove it, but died during the ill-advised surgery.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Burke has 43 of his albums.\n*He was pronounced dead at 18:32.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foote, Eugene}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
