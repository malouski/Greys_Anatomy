Robert didn't recognize him and simply asked if he was okay and gave him a free beer for being a new customer. Jackson proceeded to get drunk and when April came to find Jackson, she learned who he was.\n\nJackson went back to the diner the next night and told Robert who he was. Robert invited him inside to talk and had him try a coffee he had blended himself, which Jackson agreed was good. He then asked Jackson if he was happy. Jackson said he was and Robert said he was as well. When he told Jackson he left because he couldn't handle Catherine's expectations, Jackson left in anger.\n\nThe next day, Jackson went to Robert to say goodbye and tell him Robert wasn't his father anymore. ''(\"[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]]\")''\n\n===Jackson's Return===\nA few years later, Jackson returned to Montana to visit Robert again. As this was in the midst of the [[COVID-19 Pandemic]], Robert's diner was closed to patrons and instead he bagged up lunches for the community each day and his employee, Tate, delivered them. Since Jackson was there and wanted to talk, he enlisted Jackson's help, having him help put sandwiches together. Jackson also asked his father why he left as he'd realized it messed him up and made it hard for him to maintain good relationships. Robert admitted that he regretted leaving Jackson, but left because he didn't want to mess Jackson up, unaware that him leaving had that effect anyway. ''(\"[[Look Up Child]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married to [[Catherine Fox]]. They first met at an annual gala for the Foundation. She ignored him half the night just to spite him.\n\n===Familial===\nHe had a son, Jackson, with Catherine. When they divorced, he tried and failed to get sole custody of Jackson. After that, he had no contact with Jackson. When Jackson found Robert after years of estrangement, Jackson told Robert that he was not his father anymore.\n\nAs\u00a0[[Go Big or Go Home|implied]]\u00a0by Harper Avery himself, Harper wasn't a big fan of his son divorcing Catherine and abandoning his son. They were likely not on speaking terms as Harper closely worked with Catherine and Jackson.\n\n==Career==\nHe completed medical training and practiced as a surgeon until the pressure got to him and he walked away from medicine and his family. He moved to Montana and bought a diner called Jefferson Grill.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He plays golf on the weekends.\n*A deleted scene from\u00a0[[Roar]]\u00a0shows Jackson telling Bailey about his father being appointed Chief of a hospital by Catherine. He mismanaged the hospital, losing millions of dollars and causing a lot of people to lose their jobs. Catherine then fired him publicly. Afterwards, he ran off and left her to raise Jackson by herself.\n*He created five different coffee blends.<ref>[[Look Up Child]], 17x14</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x16RobertAvery.png|[[Who Is He (And What Is He To You)?]]\n17x14RobertAvery.png|[[Look Up Child]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x16-9.jpg\n13x16-10.jpg\n13x16-11.jpg\n13x16-12.jpg\n13x16-13.jpg\n13x16-15.jpg\n13x16-17.jpg\n13x16-18.jpg\n13x16-19.jpg\n13x16-20.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Robert Avery Appearances}}\n\n[[fr:Robert Avery]]\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Avery, Robert}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
