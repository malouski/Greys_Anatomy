He was told that surgery to resect it was very risky, but without the surgery, he'd be dead within a month. He decided to take the chance. Before his surgery, he asked Stephanie to tell him a joke because he thought he'd like to go out with a laugh if he didn't make it, but she was unable to come up with one in time. The resection went well, but after the tumor was removed, he threw a clot and coded. They were able to resuscitate, but the time without oxygen left Andy brain dead. Knowing that it was important to Andy, Maggie saw to it that his organs were donated. His liver was donated to [[Chelsea Keen]].\n\n==Career==\nHe was a shuttle commander.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 59 at the time of his death.\n*He weighed 180 pounds.\n*He didn't drink or smoke.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Billings, Andrew}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
