She was diagnosed in utero with an omphalocele, meaning she'd need to have surgery to push her abdominal contents back in once she was born. When their mother was 32 weeks pregnant, she was hospitalized until she was ready to deliver, which she hoped would not be until 36 weeks. However, she started having contractions at just 32 weeks. They put her in trendellenberg and put her on magnesium to try to stop the labor. Despite their efforts, her placenta started tearing, forcing them to deliver all five babies at 32 weeks. ''(\"[[Much too Much]]\")''\n\n===Infancy===\nAfter birth, Julie had surgery on her omphalocele. Because of her small size, they weren't able to reduce the entire sack into her abdomen, so they had to wait and do a second surgery. ''(\"[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe is part of a set of quintuplets. Their parents also have a set of triplets.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Her mother said she was pretty mellow in utero.<ref>[[Much too Much]], 2x10</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Appearances===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x10JulieRussell.png|[[Much too Much]]\n2x11JulieRussell.png|[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Julie Russell Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Russell, Julie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neonatal)]]"}}}]}}}}
