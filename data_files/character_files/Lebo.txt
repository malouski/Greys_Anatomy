After a month, Abena was ready to go home, but as they were leaving the hospital, Lebo collapsed in severe abdominal pain. They took her into the ER, where they found out she was pregnant. She hadn't told them because she was worried they'd say she couldn't fly and she needed to be there with her sister. She had blood in her abdomen from what they believed was a splenic rupture, so they took her into surgery. They opened her up, but there was no rupture on her spleen, so they looked for other causes. While they were looking in her intestines, they found her baby, who had implanted there because of scarring on her fallopian tubes. Lucy stepped in and delivered the baby and then said they needed to remove as much of the placenta as they could, as it was the cause of the bleeding. After her surgery, she and the baby were both stable, though Alex was concerned about their ability to get follow-up visits.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe came to Seattle with her sister. She didn't tell the doctors she was pregnant because she was worried they'd tell her she couldn't fly.\n\nWhen her son was born, she was told he was healthy despite attaching to her intestines instead of her uterus.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 17 at the time of her son's birth.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
