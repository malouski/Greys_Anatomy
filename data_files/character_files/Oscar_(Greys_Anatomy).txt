Shane theorized that that's why he was abandoned: his parents thought he was more trouble than he was worth since he'd already had surgery and would need many more.\n\n===Being Abandoned===\nThe expense and stress of his care is likely what led them to abandon him behind the hospital where he was found by [[Jo Wilson]] and [[Stephanie Edwards]].\n\n===Further Surgeries===\nAfter being examined at the hospital, it was determined that Oscar had Shone's Complex, which Cristina describes as the trifecta of heart defects. He had had a coarctation to his aorta, which someone had poorly tried to fix, which necessitated Cristina re-opening it. After that procedure, Oscar was discovered to have a mitral valve rupture, so he was taken back into surgery.\n\n===Police Investigation===\nThe doctors determined that there was no history of Oscar having been born or seen at [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] and [[Marilyn Rocher|a social worker]] came to handle his case while they searched for whoever abandoned him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*The name Oscar comes from Sesame Street, in which Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash can.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Oscar}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
