While they were driving, Rhys passed out twice, so Noah had [[Arvin]] drive them to the hospital. Rhys thought it was just strep throat, for which he'd been taking antibiotics for two days. Meredith looked an observed a peritonsillar abscess, which needed to be drained. His films then showed air around his trachea and a CT showed that he had necrotizing fasciitis. It had spread throughout his neck and chest, so they rushed him into surgery, where they cut out all the infected tissue. After surgery, his mother was told they believed they'd gotten it all and he'd be okay. They also said they probably wouldn't have been successful if he'd come in any later.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nRhys's mother is dating [[Noah (At Last)|Noah]], who encouraged Rhys to think of him like a father, though Rhys wasn't interested in doing so.\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
