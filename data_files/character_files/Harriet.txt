Because [[Jerry]] was also upset at the doctors, Bailey told them to put the two of them into a room together. When they came back later to check on them, they found Harriet and Jerry in bed together.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nWhile she was hospitalized, she was put in the same room as [[Jerry]] to encourage them to follow directions so they could be discharged.
