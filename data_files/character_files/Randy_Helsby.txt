[[Owen Hunt]] tracked his recurrences from there and took his case when he came back in for another resection. When they took him in, the scarring was fusing his organs, so they closed and told him he was going to die.\n\nWhen they heard the news, Randy's girlfriend, [[Angela (Tainted Obligation)|Angela]], begged them to try something else. Inspired by her own battle with cancer, Izzie asked Owen to try other options. He ultimately agreed, but Randy died in surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe'd been dating [[Angela (Tainted Obligation)|Angela]] for eight years when he died. He planned to propose, but he got distracted by his cancer. He had the ring in his mouth guard case. They had bought a condo together and rescued a puppy. Randy decided before his surgery not to wait any longer to propose, but he died before he got the chance.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 31 at the time of his death.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Helsby, Randy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
