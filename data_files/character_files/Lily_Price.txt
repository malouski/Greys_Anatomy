The tumor was benign, but was blocking her airway, making it hard for her to breathe. She'd had surgeries to remove it in the past, but it kept growing back. When she stopped breathing in the hospital, they tried a bronchoscope, but it didn't work, so they had to do a percutaneous tracheotomy, which allowed her to breathe again. Then they took her into the OR to put in a trach.\n\nLily's scans revealed that in order to remove her tumor again, they'd have to remove her trachea, which would leave her completely unable to breathe. They later found another option. They placed a stent to help her breathe for a while and then removed cartilage from a rib to help grow her a new trachea, so they could implant a trachea made from her own tissue when they had to remove hers. They grew the trachea in a lab for a while and then put it in her abdomen to let it continue to grow until it was ready.\n\nAfter her surgery, she was asked what the best part of her experience was. She brought [[Alex Karev]] to her class to speak.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nLily's mother was only able to visit her a few times a week because they lived three hours away.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was nine at the time of her surgery.\n*She and her mom live more than three hours away from the hospital.\n*Her teacher is Ms. McKee, an obvious reference to writer [[Stacy McKee]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Price, Lily}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ENT)]]"}}}]}}}}
