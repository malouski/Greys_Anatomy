''(\"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\")''\n\n===Working at Grey Sloan===\nMabel participated in a skills lab at Grey Sloan. During the lab, she corrected [[Zander Perez]] on something and got Richard to back her up, though they both noticed he didn't seem enthused to be working with them. He later sent them all home early. ''(\"[[A Diagnosis]]\")''\n\nLater, Mabel did another skills lab with the other residents, though they didn't take it seriously. That same day, she also rounded on [[Ava Gutierrez]] with Richard Webber. ''(\"[[Snowblind]]\")''\n\n===Richard's Surgery===\nMabel was among the medical staff in the gallery watching Richard's explantation and hip replacement. ''(\"[[Put on a Happy Face]]\")''\n\n===Guarding the PPE===\nWhen a shipment of PPE arrived at the hospital, which they expected to contain masks and gloves, Tom assigned Mabel and Taryn to guard it as they opened it. However, when thy opened the boxes, they learned it was all booties and no masks. ''(\"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\")''\n\nMabel was briefly on Meredith's case after she was diagnosed with Covid-19 before a new rule was implemented disallowing interns and residents to work on any patients with Covid or suspected Covid. Later, while waiting in line to be tested for Covid, Mabel was pulled out of line to teach [[Sara Ortiz]] the proper way to don and doff PPE after Owen noticed she was not wearing it properly. ''(\"[[My Happy Ending]]\")''\n\n===Dave Oyadomari===\nWhen [[Dave Oyadomari]] came back into the ER after falling off a stepladder and injuring himself, Mabel ended up on the case. Due to his being Asian, she quickly realized he'd been misdiagnosed with appendicitis due to a prior ER visit and instead had right-sided diverticulitis, which had perforated after he was sent home. Owen allowed her to scrub in due to her catching the correct diagnosis. After Dave's surgery, Mabel went to talk to Owen about how his medical care, which was centered on European norms, had led to Dave being seriously injured, causing him a month off work that would otherwise have been avoided. However, before she could confront him, Nico sent her out of the room, having previously advised her not to risk her residency over it. Instead, he confronted Owen himself. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n===Tad===\nAfter [[Tad (Station 19)|Tad]] was shot in the head with an arrow, Mabel greeted the aid car in the ambulance bay. When she saw they'd rigged a hammock in the aid car to hold his head up as it couldn't rest flat on the gurney, she called it genius. She told the firefighters that she had trauma and neurosurgery waiting for him. ''(\"[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\")''\n\n===Chad Anderson===\nWhen [[Chad Anderson]] was brought to the ER with COVID symptoms after collapsing while jogging, Mabel treated him in the ER, though he mistook her for a nurse. Later, when Chad signed himself out against medical advice, Mabel treated him again just outside the hospital when he collapsed again. He died shortly afterward. ''(\"[[Sign O' the Times]]\")''\n\n===Surgical Contest===\nIn order to inspire the residents and help them catch up on their surgical education, Richard had them all come in early one morning to start a surgical contest starting in the skills lab. He explained that they'd be judge in four areas: laparascopic, suturing, vascular skills, and endoscopic techniques. At the end of the day, the resident with the highest score would scrub in on a surgery at their skill level. They started with laparascopic skills. After that, they practiced sutures. He gave them 20 seconds to tie three square knots without moving the soda can where the ties were attached. When the time was up, Link declared Levi the winner. They also used a computer came to practice endoscopic skills, with Mabel beating Taryn when they went head-to-head. After that finished, with all points tallied, Richard declared Levi the overall winner and said he'd get to scrub in on [[Robin Jeter]], who had a foreign body obstructing her intestines.\n\nThe extraction went well, with Taryn assisting, but when he went to close, he struggled. Bailey turned on the speaker in the gallery, where the other residents were watching, and they all offered up tips and with their help, Levi was able to finish the surgery and close. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n===Grand Rounds===\nThe residents were told they'd have a surprise guest for grand rounds one day. Right before it started, they learned that guest was [[Addison Forbes Montgomery]]. When they met, she quizzed Levi on a medical fact related to her case and when he got it right, told him he'd be presenting the case. She then took them to meet [[Tovah Freedman]], who had had a hysterectomy due to placental abruption and then had lost her husband. She was there in the hopes that a uterine transplant could help her conceive and carry a healthy pregnancy. The residents all observed the surgery and answered questions as Addison asked them until the HVAC system went offline and some of them were called away to help move patients and cancel surgeries. Despite this, Addison completed her surgery and afterward, the residents followed Meredith and Addison and continued their gossip. When they saw them exiting the elevator with Addison crying, they assumed Meredith had said something to make her cry. ''(\"[[Hotter Than Hell]]\")''\n\n===The Webber Method===\nWanting to train up the residents quickly to avoid some of the fallout of the physician shortage, Richard deployed The Webber Method when he took back over as residency director. This involved having the residents take the lead on several cholecystectomy patients, operating on a staggered schedule so the attending could rotate through ORs to be available to help during the most complicated part of the surgery. Taryn faced a complication when her patient began bleeding profusely, forcing her to convert to an open procedure, but, with Bailey's help, she was able to finish the surgery successfully. In total, 13 patients were treated using this method. ''(\"[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer grandparents were sent to an interment camp at Jerome. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\n==Career==\nShe's a second-year [[Resident|resident]]. She was working at [[Pacific Northwest General Hospital]]. When it was purchased, she came over to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]] to interview to keep her job. She was hired at Grey Sloan.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She is Gosei on her mother's side.<ref>[[You'll Never Walk Alone]], 17x04</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" crop=\"true\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x13MabelTseng.png|[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\n16x14MabelTseng.png|[[A Diagnosis]]\n16x15MabelTseng.png|[[Snowblind]]\n17x01MabelTseng.png|[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\n17x03MabelTseng.png|[[My Happy Ending]]\n17x04MabelTseng.png|[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\nS194x08MabelTseng.png|[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]\n17x12MabelTseng.png|[[Sign O' the Times]]\n18x04MabelTseng.png|[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n16x15-36.jpg\n16x15-37.jpg\n17x03-6.jpg\n18x02-1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Mabel Tseng Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tseng, Mabel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
