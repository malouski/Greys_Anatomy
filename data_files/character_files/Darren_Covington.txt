He joined Meredith and Derek's clinical trial in the hopes that it'd work.\n\nIn surgery, the virus was injected successfully and he survived the surgery, but later that night, he coded and died. The virus had reverted and caused encephalitis.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was dating [[Todd Vernon]], a fellow soldier. When he was diagnosed with an inoperable glioma, Todd came to the hospital, though Darren said that he should just move on and leave. Before Darren was taken into surgery, he was given a chance to talk to Todd, but he declined when he saw his father nearby.\n\n===Familial===\nHis father was upset that he was dating another man. Darren said that his father wasn't a bad guy. He's just a soldier.\n\n==Career==\nHe was in the US Army. He knew when he joined that he'd have to hide the fact that he was gay, though he never thought he'd meet someone in the Army.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was the fifth trial patient.\n*Derek used his scans for his proposal to Meredith.<ref>[[Elevator Love Letter]], 5x19</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x14-13.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Covington, Darren}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
