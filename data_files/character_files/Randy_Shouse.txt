The intent was to go over the house and into a pool, but he missed and was seriously injured. He had multiple broken bones as well as bilateral hip dislocations. He wanted to have his hips reduced on camera, but when he felt how bad it would hurt, he backed out and agreed to have it done in surgery. They took him into the OR to reduce his hips and repair his fractures. After surgery, he was awake and stable.\n\nHe asked [[Owen Hunt]] if his injuries were the worst he'd seen. Owen said no, that honor belonged to a soldier who jumped on a bomb to save six other soldiers. After Owen left, Randy told Marcus to stop filming.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\n[[Marcus]] is one of his friends. Marcus filmed the accident and brought his camera to the hospital to keep filming.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 23 at the time of his accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shouse, Randy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
