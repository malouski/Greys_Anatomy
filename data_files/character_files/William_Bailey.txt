He was disappointed in her because he felt she traded her family for surgery. He came to Christmas dinner with her at [[Meredith's House]], where she confronted him, saying she didn't want the relationship she had with Tucker to be the example of love she showed her son. Her son was well-loved, happy, and healthy.\n\nHe spent New Year's Eve with Tucker and Little Tuck. ''(\"[[Holidaze]]\")''\n\n===Miranda's Wedding===\nBill attended his daughter's second wedding along with his wife, Elena. ''(\"[[Things We Said Today]]\")''\n\n===Moving to Seattle, COVID-19, and Elena's Death===\nBailey moved her parents to an assisted living facility in Seattle. Shortly after their move, the COVID-19 pandemic hit Seattle, preventing Bailey from visiting her parents. ''(\"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\")''\n\nBailey's father struggled with his wife's dementia, plus not being able to see his daughter except on the phone screen. When he learned that Elena had COVID and was dying, he wanted to be with her, despite Bailey telling him it wasn't safe. While he was stuck at Bailey's hotel, Bailey herself was at the hospital, holding Elena's hand as she died. ''([[Fight the Power]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nWilliam Bailey was married to Elena Bailey until her death. They'd been happily married for over sixty years.\n\n===Familial===\n====[[Miranda Bailey]]====\nMiranda Bailey is William's daughter. As a child, Miranda shared a very close relationship with her father. However, when he found out she divorced\u00a0[[Tucker Jones]], there were some struggles between them because she was operating on a patient during the holidays.\n\n====Danielle Bailey====\nBefore Miranda was born, he and Elena had another daughter, Danielle, who died of SIDS when she was two months old. This led to Elena being overprotective of her living daughter. ''(\"[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\")''\n\n====Claire====\nThough it's unknown in what way Claire is related to William Bailey, she was present at the preparations for Miranda's wedding. She also sat next to William Bailey at the wedding, so it can be presumed she is close family.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Even though he's no longer his son-in-law, William still has a good relationship with\u00a0[[Tucker Jones]]. He spent New Year's Eve with him and his grandson.<ref>[[Holidaze]], 6x10</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Appearances===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x10WilliamBailey.png|[[Holidaze]]\n9x10WilliamBailey.png|[[Things We Said Today]]\n14x11WilliamBailey.png|[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\n17x05WilliamBailey.png|[[Fight the Power]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x10-46.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[de:William Bailey]]\n[[fr:William Bailey]]\n\n==Appearances==\n{{William Bailey Appearances}}\n{{Scrollbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bailey, William}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
