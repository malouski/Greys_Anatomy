She said she flew through a window. She then drove herself to the hospital and wandered into the ER, covered in blood and confused, before collapsing into [[Addison Forbes Montgomery|Addison's]] arms.\n\nShe had shards of glass imbedded in her face and arms. She also told the doctors she was ten weeks pregnant. They started carefully removing the pieces of glass from her skin. Her baby was also stable, but the x-ray showed a shard of glass going into her heart. They scheduled surgery for her, but before she could be taken, she became unstable, so she was rushed into surgery.\n\nIn surgery, they removed the shard of glass and repaired the damage. They prepared to take her off bypass, but Burke was called to help in another OR, so he left Cristina to monitor her while he went to the other patient. Janelle's heart started beating, so Cristina knew that she was ready to come off bypass. However, Burke was still gone. He came back just as she was paging someone else to help her take Janelle of bypass to avoid her having a stroke. Burke took her off bypass, but one of her stitches blew and she started seriously bleeding. Burke had to put her back on bypass and was able to repair the heart wall. After her surgery, she and the baby were both stable.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nJanelle was no longer speaking to the father of her baby. She said he was scum as he'd cheated on her.\n\n===Familial===\nJanelle was ten weeks pregnant.\n\n===Professional===\nShe says the Dickersons are her best customers.\n\n==Career==\nShe sells vegetables at the fish market at the wharf.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duco, Janelle}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]"}}}]}}}}
