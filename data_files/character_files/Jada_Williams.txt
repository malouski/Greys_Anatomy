They'd been talking to someone on Instagram whom they believed to be a young influencer who offered to teach them how to make a lot of money. They left the house in the middle of the night to meet her, but when they arrived, she wasn't there. Instead, [[Robert Corson|Bob Corson]] grabbed them and put them in a van. He then took them back to his house and locked them in a room in the basement.\n\nJada and Shanice heard voices, which made them believe they were being rescued. They then didn't hear voices anymore, so they decided to start a fire to try to lure rescue. They started the fire and watched as it burned around them. They were finally rescued when the fire drew the attention of the firefighters outside. Sullivan and Dean decided not to wait for gear and went into the house in their street clothes. They followed the girls' voices to the basement and then to a locked door. They kicked in the door and pulled both girls out. Once they were outside, they started breathing again. When Shanice was loaded into an aid car, she explained what had happened and apologized. There was a confrontation between the cops and the others, during which Jada's mother, Joyce, was arrested, along with two firefighters. Jada and Shanice were taken to the hospital to be treated. ''(\"[[Out of Control]]\")''\n\nIn the ER, Jada was treated for smoke inhalation and burns on her hands. When she told the doctors about her mother being arrested, Jackson called his lawyers and they were able to get her out so she could come to the hospital and be with her daughter. Then she was told if her next x-ray was clear, she could take Jada home. ''(\"[[No Time for Despair]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhen she went missing, her mother immediately went into action to find her. At the hospital, she told Sharon that her father was in Nevada seeing her grandmother, who wouldn't stop going in public without a mask.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 13 years old at the time of her abduction.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\nS194x05JadaWilliams.png|[[Out of Control]]\n17x06JadaWilliams.png|[[No Time for Despair]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x06-5.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Jada Williams Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Jada}}\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 Characters]]\n[[Category:S19 S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:S19 Rescuees]]"}}}]}}}}
