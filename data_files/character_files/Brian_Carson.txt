[[Callie Torres]] was called in to consult and she developed a plan that would amputate his left leg and re-attach it in the center of his body after removing the cancerous bone. She and her team practiced the surgery and intended to practice a few more times, but Brian fell and fractured his pelvis, meaning they had to operate immediately.\n\nDespite [[William Thorpe|Will Thorpe's]] reservations, Brian said he wanted the surgery. They took him into surgery and were able to complete the operation with only a few minor problems. ''(\"[[All Eyez on Me]]\")''\n\nCallie later said that he was healing great, according to the Bauer doctors. ''(\"[[Odd Man Out]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe has two daughters and was expecting another. He'd missed both of the first two births and wanted to be present for the third.\n\n==Career==\nHe is a sergeant in the U.S. Army.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 35 at the time of his surgery.\n*He did five tours of duty.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n12x13-4.jpg\n12x13-5.jpg\n12x13-6.jpg\n12x13-7.jpg\n12x13-24.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carson, Brian}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
