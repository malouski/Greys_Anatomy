He was selected to participate in Derek's NGF surgical trial. His wife, Allison, was hopeful that his condition could be reversed entirely by the drug because damage reversal was seen in rats and monkeys.\n\nWhile waiting for his surgery, Daniel became confused and kept asking for his wife, [[Victoria]]. [[Meredith Grey|Meredith]] asked his wife who Victoria was and she told her that Victoria was a woman who lived in the same nursing home as Daniel. They'd met the previous year there and despite both of them being married, they fell in love.\n\nBefore his surgery, Allison begged Alex just to give Daniel the drug because she needed her husband. Alex said he couldn't because even he didn't know ahead of time. Daniel was designated to receive the placebo, which was injected in his surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, he was awake and asked again for Victoria. His wife was upset, so Alex told her just to be patient, to be whatever he needed, even if that didn't mean being his wife. She then told Daniel she'd go get Victoria for him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Allison Cobb]]====\nHe is married to [[Allison Cobb]]. They met when they were at college together when he saw her in the student union and followed her to her French poetry class in a snowstorm. He sat through her class for five months, trying to get up the nerve to talk to her. Forty years later, they were still together despite Daniel falling in love with another woman after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.\n\n====[[Victoria]]====\nDespite being married to Allison, when he wasn't lucid, he believed he was married to Victoria. He and Victoria lived in the same nursing home and had fallen in love over the past year, despite them both being married.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n7x13-8.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cobb, Daniel}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
