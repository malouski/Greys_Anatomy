Sam noted that it was her fourth sports injury in three months and asked what was going on. She said she was a normal, sexual person, but her husband, [[Paul (Season 3)|Paul]], wouldn't have sex with her. They hadn't had sex in 18 months. She turned to exercise in order to avoid cheating on him. Sam referred her to see [[Violet Turner]].\n\nKathy and Paul came in to see Violet and Paul said he wanted to have sex, but he wanted to want it. Violet then ordered him to have sex with his wife, whether or not he was in the mood.\n\nThey reported back that he had erectile dysfunction, so Sam agreed to run tests to look for a physical problem. Kathy went out that night and was out all night. However, she showed up to Paul's appointment and told him she hadn't cheated, even though she'd had the chance to. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part 1]]\")''\n\nPaul's test results showed a tumor on his adrenal gland that was causing his problems. Because of the type of tumor it was, treatment was difficult and risky, but Paul was told there was hope.\n\nAfter hearing her husband's diagnosis, Kathy spoke to Violet. She confessed that she had lied to Paul and she had slept with another man the night she didn't come home. She wanted to know what to do. Violet told her just to keep loving her husband. Kathy told her she'd have to tell her that a lot, which Violet agreed to do. ''(\"[[The Other Side of This Life, Part 2]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Paul (Season 3)|Paul]]. She was upset because he had no desire to have sex with her. When she found out he had an adrenal tumor that was causing his low sex drive, she was upset. She confessed to Violet that she had slept with another man the night she was out all night.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She has a pool at her house.<ref>[[The Other Side of This Life, Part 1]], 3x22</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n322Kathy.png|[[The Other Side of This Life, Part 1]]\n323Kathy.png|[[The Other Side of This Life, Part 2]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Kathy Appearances}}\n\n{{Scrollbox}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Psych)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
