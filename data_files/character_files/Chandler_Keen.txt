When she arrived at the hospital, Chandler learned that her sister was in acute liver failure and would need a transplant. Chandler immediately offered to donate her own liver, but her labs showed that she was pregnant, making her ineligible to donate. They were forced to wait for another liver to become available very quickly or Chelsea would die. Later that night, [[Andrew Billings]] was pronounced brain dead and his liver was donated to Chelsea.\n\nChandler called her husband to tell him she was going to stay the night at the hospital to be with Chelsea and also to share the news of her pregnancy, saying she wanted to tell him to his face, but also couldn't stand knowing and him not knowing.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to a man named Rick.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her twin sister, Chelsea, are very close. When they were kids, they had a deal where if one of them was in trouble, the other would trade with her and go get yelled at in her sister's place. Chandler offered to donate a portion of her liver to Chelsea, but was ineligible due to pregnancy.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 25 at the time of her sister's liver transplant.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keen, Chandler}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
