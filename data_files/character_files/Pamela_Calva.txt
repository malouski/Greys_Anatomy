One day, while she was driving, an orgasm caused her to get into a minor car accident. In the ER, she said that she'd seen her doctor, but he just referred her to a shrink without running any tests.\n\nAddison ran a CT and Pamela had an orgasm while in the machine, so they had to re-start.\n\nWhen asked if she really wanted to get rid of the orgasms, she said she did because while she likes sex, it makes it hard to live her life when she's having orgasms constantly.\n\nWhile she was being prepped for her surgery, Pamela asked if she'd still be able to have orgasms when she wanted to afterward and she was assured that she would.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer father came to the hospital when she was brought in after her car accident. They were both embarrassed by her public, vocal orgasms.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She's a junior math major at UW.\n*She made the honor roll.\n*The aired episode gives no direct cause for the spontaneous orgasms that Pamela Calva suffers from.\u00a0Krista Vernoff\u00a0explained in [[Yesterday/Grey Matter|her blog post]] that Pamela had a small tumor on her pudendal artery, which supplies blood to the clitoris, that led to that area constantly being stimulated.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Calva, Pamela}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
