Her research into curing autism piqued his interest because he thought he could apply it to his own research, so they worked closely together. When she hit a wall and became frustrated, he encouraged her to keep going, saying she was frustrated because she was close to a breakthrough. He ended up working on her research on his own. He called her in the middle of the night when he found something. She came into the lab and when she saw what he had discovered, she was so excited that she said she could kiss him, but then said she wouldn't. Despite this, the two shared a kiss, after which Derek pulled back and said that he loves his wife and doesn't want anyone but her, leading him to leave the NIH to go back to [[Seattle]].
