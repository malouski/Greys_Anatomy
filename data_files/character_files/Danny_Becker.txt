The hotel caught on fire and Danny's mother was burned. They were both taken to the ER, where Danny was examined and said to be okay. His mother asked if he could stay in the ER with her until his dad arrived. However, when she had trouble breathing, he brought a doctor to her. While the doctors were working on her, he wandered away and grabbed the defibrillator that had been charged for [[Roy Mackinaw]]. [[Cristina Yang]] yelled at him to put the paddles down, which scared him. He was then taken out of the ER, where he was watched first by [[Lexie Grey]] and then by a candy striper until his dad arrived at the hospital to take him.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHe and his mother were on their way to visit his father when they were in a hotel fire.
