He had seven broken toes, so Alex taped the toes together so they could heal and gave him some crutches.\n\nHowever, as [[April Kepner|April]] had caught his eye, he returned to the hospital the next day. When Alex tried to get him to leave, he lied and said he had chest pain, so that Alex would have to keep him to run tests.\n\nWhile he was waiting for tests to be run, a patient was brought in who had injured several convention attendees and was starting to attack the hospital staff and patients. Carter tried to stand up to him, but ended up getting further injured. He had to be taken into surgery to repair a splenic laceration.\n\nAfter his surgery, Alex wheeled him up to April, who thanked him for what he had done in the ER. However, she said she didn't know what hobbits are. He then heard Tia talking about how she didn't understand how April didn't know what hobbits are. He said hi to her and they shared a smile.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nWhile in the hospital, he saw April Kepner in the ER. He developed a crush on her, saying she looked the the Dothraki Princess. However, when he found out she didn't know what hobbits are, he was turned off by that. He heard [[Tia]] saying that she didn't understand how April didn't know that and was intrigued by her. The two shared a smile.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He went to the convention dressed as a hobbit.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n8x04-5.jpg\n8x04-5.png\n8x04-15.jpg\n8x04-16.jpg\n8x04-23.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
