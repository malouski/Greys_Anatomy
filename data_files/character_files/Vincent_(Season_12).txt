Leo had fallen down the stairs coming back from his morning walk. Vincent tried to catch him, but couldn't.\n\nVincent waited at the hospital while Leo was examined. [[Angelica Paulson|Angelica]], Leo's wife, arrived at the hospital shortly after receiving a message from Vincent about Leo being in the hospital. She was told he was stable.\n\nWhile waiting for Leo to have surgery, Vincent came to see him while Angelica was out of the room getting coffee. They held hands and Leo said he'd like it if Vincent stayed and waited, so he stayed while Leo had surgery.\n\nWhile waiting for Leo to get out of surgery, he struck up a conversation with [[Stephanie Edwards]] in the waiting room. After they spoke, he offered to get her tea, which she accepted. When he overheard her being told that [[Kyle Diaz|Kyle's]] surgery had gone well, he told her he was glad it had gone well for her. She replied that she hoped it would go well for him as well.\n\nAfter Leo was out of surgery, Vincent came to visit him, but Leo said that he appreciated what he'd done for him, but he could leave.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nFor fifteen years, he had an emotional relationship with [[Leo Paulson]]. Because Leo was married, their relationship never became physical, though they had deep affection for each other. When Leo found out he had only six months to a year to live, he ended things with Vincent.\n\n==Career==\nHe is the doorman in the building where [[Leo Paulson|Leo]] and [[Angelica Paulson]] live.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Tea helps to calm him.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n12x21-10.jpg\n12x21-14.jpg\n12x21-15.jpg\n12x21-19.jpg\n12x21-21.jpg\n12x21-21.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Vincent}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
