Bailey planned to perform a whipple on him. However, Ellis took over the case as an opportunity to show off her technique. However, she ignored the fact that Barry had deep vein thrombosis, meaning that his iliac veins were not suitable for grafting. She had to cut into his neck to graft his renal vein instead. As he went to retrieve the graft, Alex was splattered with blood and noted that he may have nicked the carotid artery. Ellis was able to finish the surgery successfully despite her embarrassment.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Jill Taylor]]. He and his wife were both confused as to the change of surgeon when Ellis took over the case from Bailey.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 47 at the time of his whipple.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taylor, Barry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
