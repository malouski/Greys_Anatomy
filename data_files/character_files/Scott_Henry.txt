Their parents let them go alone because they're nerds who never get into trouble.\n\n===Tunnel Collapsed===\nWhile they were driving through a tunnel on 99, it collapsed, injuring Scott seriously. He was taken to the ER in critical condition. They worked on him in the ER for a while before saying he was losing blood faster than they could transfuse it. [[Owen Hunt|Owen]] proposed that they use cold saline to cool his body and protect his brain and organs, giving them more time work. [[Catherine Fox|Catherine Avery]] told him he couldn't do it, but he said they only needed two physicians to authorize it and [[Alex Karev|Alex]] and [[Richard Webber|Richard]] both agreed.\n\nThey cooled Scott down and started operating. They set a clock, estimating that they had 90 minutes at most to work. When they had just 16 minutes left, they noticed that he had an injury to his renal system, but because it wouldn't kill him, they quickly ligated it and closed. After they warmed him up, it took a while to get his heart beating again, but they were ultimately successful and said they'd just have to wait to see if he had good brain function.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nWhen he was injured in the tunnel collapse, Scott's parents came from Missoula to be with him in the hospital.\n\n===Friendships===\nHe is friends with [[Anna (Time Stops)|Anna]] and [[Phillip]]. The three of them made a trip to Seattle together for a college visit.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\nHe was 17 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Henry, Scott}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
