Then she started a business making peanut brittle. She also took up rollerskating with her kids. She wanted to learn the plot stop, but her kids wanted to learn the moonwalk. While attempting this, Erika skated into a railing, causing a serious abdominal injury and breaking her left leg. She was taken to the hospital, where they x-rayed her leg and examined her abdomen. After her tests, she was told they'd cast her leg and observe her abdominal bleeding. When the bleeding worsened, she was taken into surgery.\n\nAfter her surgery, she asked when she'd be able to work again. She wanted to go back to her job as a lawyer, assuming she could get hired. Bailey talked to her and said that rest wasn't a bad thing and encouraged her to do what she loved instead of returning to the job she hated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe has at least two children.\n\n==Career==\nShe was a tech lawyer, but at the start of the pandemic, she quit that job and opened a business making peanut brittle called Brown Sugar Brittle.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She lost 50 pounds after quitting her job.\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
