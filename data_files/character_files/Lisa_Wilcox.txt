She had a cut on her face, which was bandaged in the ER. She was angry because they had almost qualified for nationals. She was the cheer captain and squad leader, so she said she was kicking [[Danielle (All Eyez on Me)|Danielle]] and [[Maxine Hewitt|Maxine]] off the team because she blamed them for the fall.\n\nWhen Maxine needed surgery for a heart condition, Lisa, Danielle, and [[Chelsea]] argued about the situation. Stephanie then rallied the whole team to become a team and be supportive for Maxine. They then went to visit her in her hospital room.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nLisa and Maxine had been friends since elementary school. When Maxine started spending more time with [[Danielle (All Eyez on Me)|Danielle]], Lisa got jealous.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wilcox, Lisa}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S12 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
