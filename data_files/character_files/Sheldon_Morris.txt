[[Richard Webber]] did the surgery and afterward, Sheldon was severely jaundiced. He had obstructive jaundice, meaning Webber likely clipped the common bile duct, a very serious mistake. Scans confirmed it and he was prepped for a repair, which [[Miranda Bailey]] performed. It went well and he was expected to make a full recovery. ''(\"[[New History]]\")''\n\n===Follow-Up===\nA few months later, Sheldon came in for a follow-up. He'd been having them weekly since his surgery. He thought it was routine and didn't know that his jaundice following surgery had been due to surgeon error.
