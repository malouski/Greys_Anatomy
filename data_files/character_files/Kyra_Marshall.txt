Her antibody levels were so elevated, she was in danger of rejecting a donor heart, so she was given high levels of chemotherapy to suppress the immune system. As a result, she had to be kept in isolation to avoid infection. Dr. Hahn had said that she would have a heart within three weeks, but it was over eight before Erica had found her one.\n\nRight before her transplant, her lung collapsed. She was saved by [[Alex Karev]], who broke the isolation to treat her. Unfortunately for her, the exposure to the outside put her at further risk of infection and her heart transplant was pushed back, though her family was put in [[scrubs]] and allowed to come touch her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Lucas Marshall]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe has two daughters, [[Zoe Marshall|Zoe]] and [[Jessie Marshall|Jessie]], with her husband.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*In order to protect her little girls, she skipped over the scary parts in fairy tales, such as when Snow White dies (which Alex accidentally reveals).\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marshall, Kyra}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]"}}}]}}}}
