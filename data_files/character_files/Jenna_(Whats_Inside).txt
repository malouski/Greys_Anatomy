Arizona placed a shunt to drain the fluid around her heart, hoping to delay surgery until after she was born. However, a week later, scans showed the tumor was growing rapidly, meaning she needed surgery immediately to remove it. Nathan was supposed to operate, but Maggie decided she was going to take over the case as her first surgery back. Owen was concerned, as a friend of Jenna and Leo's, but after Leo and Jenna learned the circumstance, they decided to go with Maggie as their surgeon.\n\nJenna was taken into surgery. The mass was easily removed, but then the baby became bradycardic. Maggie decided she needed time to adjust to her heart beating without a mass attached and waited until her heart rate stabilized without intervention. They closed and Jenna was stable and awake after surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Leo]]. They were in the same unit in Afghanistan, where she dragged him out of a collapsed building.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and Leo are expecting their first child, who was conceived after trying for a long time.\n\n===Friendships===\nShe and Leo met [[Owen Hunt]] at the VA. He operated on both of them and they became friends. They also became friends with Amelia after Owen started seeing her.\n\n==Career==\nShe was in the military and served in Afghanistan.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Owen gave her a new leg and saved her hip.\n**Since they met at the VA, it's likely that Jenna was part of his and [[Callie Torres|Callie's]] robotic limb trial.\n*She doesn't have her spleen.\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Jenna}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (MFM)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
