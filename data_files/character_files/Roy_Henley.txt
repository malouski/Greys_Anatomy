He had pulmonary hypertension. He had been told by a previous doctor that he'd eventually need a lung transplant, but that he was too healthy at the time. After two days in the hospital, he had developed fungal pneumonia and was going into kidney failure. The time had come for him to get a lung transplant. [[April Kepner]] decided to convene a panel to decide whether or not Roy would going on the transplant list for new lungs. [[Cristina Yang]] tipped her off that Teddy had had two days to get him on the transplant list and she hadn't. At the panel, April recommended that Roy not be put on the transplant list. However, Cristina spoke up, saying that all his labs were borderline, but she believed Roy would live because he had the will to make it, which she says is just as important as any medical tests. ''(\"[[Almost Grown]]\")''\n\n===Lung Transplant===\nWhen lungs became available for Roy, Teddy sent Cristina to monitor him with [[Dr. McQueen|Dr. McQueen's]] help while she went to retrieve them. His daughter also agreed to come into the hospital. Shortly after she arrived, he developed cor pulmonale because of the stress his bad lungs put on his heart. His daughter was told he might need a new heart as well as his lungs. Cristina did several things in order to keep him stable while they waited for the lungs. They ended up putting him on ECMO and Teddy hoped that the heart damage would reverse once they got the lungs in. They transplanted the lungs and his heart started beating normally. ''(\"[[That's Me Trying]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe was married. He says his divorce was messy. ''(\"[[Almost Grown]]\")''\n\n===Familial===\nHe was estranged from his daughter, Corrine. He says that his divorce was messy and Corrine sided with her mother. Corrine said that he tried to be there for her for a while, but he eventually stopped because she couldn't forgive him for leaving her mother.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 57 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n705RoyHenley.png|[[Almost Grown]]\n7x07RoyHenley.png|[[That's Me Trying]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Roy Henley Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Henley, Roy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
