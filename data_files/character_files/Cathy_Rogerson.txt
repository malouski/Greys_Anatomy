[[Callie Torres|Callie]] examined her and ordered a CT. The CT revealed internal bleeding, probably caused by her anti-inflammatories. [[Preston Burke|Burke]] was called in to consult. He told Cathy that he could run a line up through her groin and use that to stop the bleeding. Even that was risky with her condition. She considered rejecting the surgery and allowing herself to bleed to death, but went through with it because of her daughter. In surgery, they were unable to stop the bleeding with the line, so they were forced to open her up, despite the additional risks. Despite their best efforts, she died during the surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nCathy was very close with her daughter, Nina. They used to build dollhouses together, but Cathy's help was limited by her condition. She said that she'd accepted that she was going to die, but Nina hadn't and Nina refused to let her talk about it. When she died, Nina was devastated.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 41 at the time of her death.\n*She used to build dollhouses.\n*She had movement only in her face and hands at the time of her death.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rogerson, Cathy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
