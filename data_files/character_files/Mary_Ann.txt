A few months later, he had right-sided paralysis and aphasia, so she took him back to the clinic, where [[James Chee]] sent him to the hospital, suspecting he was having a stroke. At the hospital, they confirmed that he'd had a stroke due a clot and told Mary Ann they'd go and remove it. She emphasized how important her grandfather was to their tribe before going into labor in the parking lot.\n\nShe was taken inside, where they were unable to get her own OB, the same OB who had delivered her, because she was busy with a premature twin delivery. Carina stepped in and successfully delivered her daughter, whom she and her husband, [[Shawn (Tradition)|Shawn]], named Rosie after her mother. After her birth, they did a video call with William, who proceeded to tell Rosie the story of their family.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Shawn (Tradition)|Shawn]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe is very close with her family. When she gave birth, she requested to have her parents there.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x15-7.jpg\n17x15-8.jpg\n17x15-9.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]"}}}]}}}}
