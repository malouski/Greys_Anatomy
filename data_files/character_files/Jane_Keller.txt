They used a clothesline to play. The tugging motion led to [[Cash Keller|Cash]], [[Deedee Keller|Deedee]], and Jane losing fingers. [[Frances Keller]] was also injured in the game when her hand was crushed.\n\nThe family went together to the ER, where the fingers were matched with their rightful owners. All the fingers were successfully re-attached and Frances was expected to regain full use of her hand after physical therapy. However, when Al tried to say that that it was good that they had family, his brother, [[Tony Keller|Tony]], punched him in the face, giving Al a nosebleed and possibly breaking Tony's hand.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Tony Keller]]. They have a daughter, [[Frances Keller]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe has a daughter and is a member of the Keller family through marriage.
