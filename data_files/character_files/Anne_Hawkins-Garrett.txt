One day, she was admitted to the hospital because she had second degree burns on both her arms. Her mothers said they didn't know how it happened because they were always so careful and Mary Rose also claimed not to know anything about it. The burns were so severe that Mary Rose was taken into surgery for debridement. After her debridement, she admitted that she'd run outside after her cat, who had escaped. She was worried her cat would get hit by a car, so she put on her helmet, but not her jacket, which is how she got the burns. Jackson agreed not to tell her moms, but said that was a one-time offer. Mary Rose said the burns hurt, so she definitely wouldn't go out without her jacket again.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Lily Hawkins-Garrett]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her wife have a daughter, Mary Rose.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hawkins-Garrett, Anne}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
