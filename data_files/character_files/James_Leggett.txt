James was a patient of [[Mark Sloan]]. Mark and [[Derek Shepherd]] did James' first cranial expansion. In total, Mark operated on James five times to give him a more normal appearance.\n\n===Final Surgery===\nMark initially planned for James's final surgery just to move his upper jaw forward. However, Jackson's plan involved his entire mid-face being moved forward in a single block. Above [[Arizona Robbins|Arizona]] and [[Derek Shepherd|Derek's]] objections, Jackson proceeded with the surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nJames was informed by Mark that since he was \"weird-looking,\" Mark's moves wouldn't work on the ladies, so he'd have to develop his own moves. At the time of his final surgery, he had a girlfriend he described as \"super hot.\"\n\n===Familial===\nJames came into the hospital with both of his parents, who had loved Mark and were sad to see that he had died. However, as Jackson was Mark's guy, they trusted him to perform James's final surgery.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 16 when he had his final surgery.\n*During his surgery, [[Arizona Robbins]] stood in the OR the whole time, watching [[Jackson Avery]] operate.\n*The monobloc advancement surgery took five hours.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Leggett, James}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
