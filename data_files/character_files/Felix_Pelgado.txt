Four months later, during a follow-up visit with his surgeon, Link, he complained that he still wasn't able to pitch at the same level as before his injury. While he was talking to Link, Amelia walked in and saw him struggle to open a water bottle with his right hand before switching to his left, making her think he had a neurological problem causing one-sided weakness. She asked him to come to the hospital for an MRI, which showed a meningioma at C6-C7. She took him into surgery, where she removed the whole tumor. After surgery, he was stable and awake and had improved strength in his arms.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He plays baseball at a junior college and hopes to be recruited to a Division 1 school.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pelgado, Felix}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]"}}}]}}}}
