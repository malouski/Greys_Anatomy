When she noticed them talking to each other, she asked if they wanted to trade to sit next to each other. Nathan said yes, but Meredith told her no. After the two of them went to the bathroom together and returned, they saw that Ingrid had moved over, leaving them two seats together.\n\nShortly after this, the plane hit turbulence. Once it had stopped, Meredith and Nathan left their seats to start treating people who were injured. Ingrid was upset that they were leaving her alone, but Nathan put her oxygen mask on her and told her to breathe.\n\nLater, Ingrid came to Nathan upset that he hadn't come back. She had a cut on her shoulder, which he cleaned for her. She then started helping them treat other patients, despite being squeamish. She helped successfully treat Max's brain bleed with Meredith.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She hates flying.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n13x20-1.jpg\n13x20-5.jpg\n13x20-6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Ingrid}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
