He was doing it not for charity (though he fell in with a few charity groups along the way for the snacks), but for the satisfaction of having completed something. However, when he was nearing the coast in [[Seattle]], he was struck by a pick-up truck.\n\n===Hospitalization===\nSam was brought into the ER at Grey Sloan Memorial, where he was diagnosed with blunt trauma injuries, as well as a broken femur which had lacerated his femoral artery, causing blood to pool in his thigh. He was taken to the OR where an external fixator was placed on his leg and his other injuries were repaired.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 23 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*His trip across the country took three months and started in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roane, Sam}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
