She was airlifted from [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]] to [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] so the doctors could try to make a plan to remove her tumor. The tumor was large and wrapped around several of her organs. Meredith used [[Anatomy Jane]] to explain the tumor to Tori and her family.\n\nHer grandmother then insisted that [[Erica Hahn]] be on the team, because Dr. Stewart had told them that she was the best cardiovascular surgeon. Erica wasn't optimistic about Tori's chances for survival, because three other hospitals had turned them away. Despite this, she joined the team and they started discussing options. Meredith suggested that they take out the organs that were involved in the blood supply in order to resect the tumor. They needed to figure out a way to give them the time they needed to do that. They decided to take the organs out and put them on ice while they cut out the tumor.\n\nThey took Tori into surgery and started resecting the tumor. They hit a wall when they didn't have enough tissue to re-attach the organs. They agreed to use human umbilical vein to bridge the gap. Once they were done, they were able to reconnect the organs and close. She was stable after surgery.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nThe Beglers are a very close family. When Tori was hospitalized, several members of her family came to the hospital to be with her, to make sure she was okay.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 10 at the time of her tumor resection.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Begler, Tori}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
