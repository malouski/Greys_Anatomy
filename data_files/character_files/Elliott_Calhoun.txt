While he was fasting in preparation for his surgery, his wife, Finley's, water broke, a month before her due date. Their son, Jasper, was born that day, one month early. He was taken to the NICU, where he was said to be doing well. Elliott was taken into surgery. His valve replacement went well, but his heart didn't restart when they were finished like it should have. Teddy believed it was due to hibernating myocardium and said they just needed to give Elliott more time. They told Finley about this and she was upset that they couldn't tell her definitively that it would work.

Andrew slowly weaned him off the pacing wires and ECMO and Elliott's condition stabilized.
