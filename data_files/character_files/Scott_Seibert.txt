A car had cut Bob off and he, in a rage, caused an accident. The driver of the other car involved died and Bob was left in critical condition. Lea and Scott had only minor injuries and had to be monitored, but Bob was seriously injured and had to be taken into surgery. Even before the accident, he was in liver failure and his condition was worsened by the car accident. While the doctors were operating, they asked about a potential donor. Scott had been tested as a match, but hadn't agreed to be a donor. Lea pressured her son to donate, as they were informed that Bob wouldn't survive the surgery without a transplant. After speaking with [[Alex Karev|Alex]] about his own experience, Scottie agreed to donate, but only on the condition that he and his mom moved out of the house and she told the police everything her husband had been doing to her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nScott's father was abusive toward his mother, making Scott very protective over her. When his father needed a liver transplant, Scott went into counseling to decide whether or not to give his father a portion of his. The decision was rushed when they were injured in a car accident that his father had caused. Scott ultimately decided to give his father a portion of his liver, but only if his mother agreed that they would move out and she'd tell the police everything his father had been doing to her.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 18 at the time of the car accident.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n202-14.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seibert, Scott}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
