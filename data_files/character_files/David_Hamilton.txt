He noticed the signs, but didn't know what they meant. When he asked her about them, she bit his head off. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n===Courting Meredith===\nDavid invited Meredith to come to Minnesota as they were dedicating a research library to her mother. When she arrived, he gave her a tour of the facility and told her he was doing additional research into mRNA technology as part of vaccine development and cancer treatment. He then showed her a research lab that he'd had set up and asked her to work there, developing a cure for Parkinson's, a condition which he had.\n\nHe then took her out to dinner, where he elaborated on the proposed treatment and talked to Meredith about his own treatment, which he said usually worked well enough to get him through consults with patients before wearing off. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\nAs Meredith considered his offer, she brought Amelia to Minnesota to tour the facility and examine David. She asked if he'd considered options like deep-brain stimulation, but he said he wanted a cure, which is why she was there. They just needed Meredith to say yes. At the end of the day, Meredith said she needed full autonomy to pick the team, wanted everything they learned to be accessible to anyone with Parkinson's, and asked to have the project moved to Grey Sloan. David said he couldn't do that, but did agree to let Meredith set up a satellite lab there so she could do most of her work there and travel to Minnesota once a week. ''(\"[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]]\")''\n\n===Research Beginnings===\nDavid observed as research began. The first step was proving that the cells could stay alive after being injected. David became irritated when he learned that Meredith had brought Tom Koracick onto the project as Koracick had slept with his daughter, which David didn't like. Meredith reminded him that he had given her full autonomy over the staff for the project and Amelia needed a second neurosurgeon. ''(\"[[Bottle Up and Explode!]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nHe knew [[Ellis Grey]] when she was alive. He also did the conference circuit with Richard, who said David would make a terrible boss.\n\n==Career==\nHe is an [[Attending|attending]] [[General Surgery|general surgeon]] at [[Mayo Clinic|The Mayo Clinic]] in Rochester, MN. [[Richard Webber|Dr. Webber]] described him as Minnesota's prized tumor guy. Because of his Parkinson's diagnosis, he is retired from surgery but still consults on general surgery patients. Additionally, because of his diagnosis, he founded [[The Grey Center]] with the hopes of curing his disease. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He is self-proclaimed as \"Minnesota's [retired] Thoroughbred\" but still \"pretty good\".
