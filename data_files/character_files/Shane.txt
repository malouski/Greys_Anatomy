He had abdominal injuries but refused to let Bailey examine him. He walked himself into the ER and requested a male doctor. He refused to be examined by her, insisting that he could wait despite being in extreme pain. [[Richard Webber]] arrived and tried to examine him, but Shane also refused, leading the doctors to realize that he wanted a white doctor. Richard left Bailey to handle it.\n\nBailey brought Cristina onto the case because she's neither white nor black. Cristina examined him and found a large swastika tattoo on his stomach. Shane had a lacerated liver and needed an exploratory laparotomy. He wouldn't consent to surgery unless he got a guarantee that there'd be at least one white doctor in the OR. Bailey got [[George O'Malley]] to scrub in so he would sign consent. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part 1]]\")''\n\nBailey completed his surgery, but after she closed, his pressure dropped, so she had to open him back up. After several complications, Bailey was finally able to close. She articulated the skin in a way that obscured his tattoo.\n\nWhen he woke up, he was upset about his ruined tattoo. George asked him about his beliefs and told him that he believed the world would be better if Shane had died. ''(\"[[Crash Into Me, Part 2]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Professional===\nDespite being racist, he got along well with his partner, [[Mary Daltrey]], who was black. He was concerned about her when she had to have surgery.\n\n==Career==\nShane is a paramedic in [[Seattle]]. [[Mary Daltrey]] was his partner.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n409Shane.png|[[Crash Into Me, Part 1]]\n410Shane.png|[[Crash Into Me, Part 2]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x10-9.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Shane Appearances}}\n[[de:Shane]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Paramedics]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
