They expected that surgery would repair her heart and she'd be okay, but in surgery, the doctors repaired the defect, but her heart was so diseased that Stacy needed a heart-lung transplant and needed constant medication while she waited for it. A missed dose would mean she'd die. When her parents were upset at the idea of her having to stay in a hospital bed, [[Miranda Bailey|Bailey]] proposed an alternative, that she wear a backpack with a bump, which would allow her to live her life normally while she waited for a transplant.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe is married to [[Dan Pollock]].\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband have a daughter, Stacy. When Stacy was in the hospital to have heart surgery, they were extremely worried.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pollock, Lisa}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
