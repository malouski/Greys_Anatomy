She bought pills that were laced with something that caused massive overdoses. When she overdosed, she was separated from her son Truman. At the hospital, she searched for him, hoping someone had seen him at the park and taken him to the hospital. The doctors tried to calm her down, believing her stress was the reason for her high blood pressure. When [[Ralph Tennyson]] came into the ER, bringing her son, Truman, he also informed the doctors that Wendy had been using drugs.\n\nThe doctors called her husband and he came to the hospital to pick up Truman.
