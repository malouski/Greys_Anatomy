The roller coaster derailed and the car they were in crashed into the ground. Since Greg had serious crush injuries, the whole car was transported to the hospital so they could be carefully extracted from the car. In the ER, firefighters removed Greg's harness, which left him struggling to breathe. His neck had been fractured, so he was put in traction to stabilize his neck then removed to a gurney, where he was taken to CT. He had bleeding in his abdomen, so he was taken into surgery so that could be repaired and then he had a spinal fusion. After surgery, he was stable.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nHe is friends with his fellow residents, [[Cleo Kim]] and [[Liza Simmons]].\n\n==Career==\nHe is a second-year [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 26 at the time of his hospitalization.\n*He is\u00a0[[Liza Simmons|Liza Simmons's]]\u00a0birthing partner.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x07-41.jpg\n14x07-42.jpg\n14x07-43.jpg\n14x07-44.jpg\n14x07-45.jpg\n14x07-46.jpg\n14x07-47.jpg\n14x07-48.jpg\n14x07-49.jpg\n14x07-50.jpg\n14x07-51.jpg\n14x07-53.jpg\n14x07-54.jpg\n14x07-55.jpg\n14x07-56.jpg\n14x07-57.jpg\n14x07-58.jpg\n14x07-60.jpg\n14x07-62.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williams, Gregory}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
