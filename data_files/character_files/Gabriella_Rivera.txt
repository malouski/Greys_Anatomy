Because she'd been detained at the border with her mother, her father didn't know how long she'd been in pain and the detention center only gave her an antacid to treat her. She had an intestinal blockage, which they were unable to resolve with an enema. She was then taken into surgery, where they took a biopsy while they resolved her blockage. The biopsy diagnosed her with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Because her father was uninsured, but made too much money to qualify for Medicaid for Gabby, Meredith used [[Ellis Shepherd|her daughter's]] name and insurance on the paperwork to get it covered. When Richard found out about it, he was upset that she'd committed insurance fraud, but knew of a program that would kick in after 30 days if they could keep Gabby in the hospital the whole time, so they had to get creative about ways to justify her continuous time in the hospital. In the meantime, they encouraged Luis to go back to work to occupy his time and offered him a cot so he could sleep in Gabby's room with her. ''(\"[[What I Did for Love]]\")''\n\nGabby continued to stay in the hospital. When she had to have an MRI, she was scared, so Andrew did an MRI on her stuffed kitty, Perla, first to show her that it wasn't going to hurt her. ''(\"[[Drawn to the Blood]]\")''\n\nGabby's staging results came back and showed that it was only stage 2. After Bailey told them this, Catherine said the Foundation would cover her treatment and associated costs. She also shared her own experience with cancer and said they'd do whatever they could to make sure Gabby was okay. ''(\"[[Jump Into the Fog]]\")''\n\n===Meredith's Hearing===\nOn the day of Meredith's hearing to determine if she would lose her medical license, Gabby came to the hearing along with her father, who testified. When Gabby saw Meredith, she ran to her and gave her a hug. ''(\"[[My Shot]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer father came to the United States to get settled before sending for Gabby and her mom. When he sent for them, they were detained at the border until Gabby was finally released to him.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was four years old at the time of her diagnosis.\n*She and her family are from San Pedro Sula, Honduras.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" crop=\"true\">\n15x23GabriellaRivera.png|[[What I Did for Love]]\n15x24GabriellaRivera.png|[[Drawn to the Blood]]\n15x25GabriellaRivera.png|[[Jump Into the Fog]]\n16x08GabriellaRivera.png|[[My Shot]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x25-27.jpg\n15x25-28.jpg\n15x25-29.jpg\n15x25-30.jpg\n15x25-31.jpg\n16x08-23.jpg\n16x08-24.jpg\n16x08-25.jpg\n16x08-29.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Gabriella Rivera Appearances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rivera, Gabriella}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Clinic)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Oncology)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
