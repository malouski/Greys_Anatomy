Despite this, she was unable to land because they were flying with a storm above and below them, which made landing very risky to the other passengers.\n\nAfter getting through the storm, LeVantine was cleared for an emergency landing in Sioux Falls. Once they were on the ground, all the passengers de-planed and those who needed immediate care were met by ambulances. LeVantine found Meredith and shook her hand and told her it had been a pleasure flying with her.\n\n==Career==\nShe is a pilot.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:LeVantine, Captain}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S13 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
