His friend had shot him at his request because he liked the scars. He called them his art, and he liked suffering pain to get the scars. The bullet went through his arm and hit his ribs, cracking one and causing a hemopneumothorax. They put in a chest tube to drain the blood before re-inflating his lung. He asked to have someone take pictures, and Alex took a polaroid for him.\n\nAfter that was done, his labs showed a spike in his white blood cells, so they looked for causes of infection. Alex asked him about possible causes and Digby showed Alex the new tattoo on his calf. It was severely infected, so they moved him to the ICU, where he went into multi-system organ failure. Despite their best efforts, he was pronounced dead at 20:49.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He wrestled at Iowa State. He weighed 157 pounds at the time.\n*He was pronounced dead at 20:49.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n107-11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Owens, Digby}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
