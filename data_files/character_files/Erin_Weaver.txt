Dr. Pierce examined him and ruled out a heart attack and aortic dissection, so she handed his case off to Dr. Bailey, who began to run tests to find out the cause. Jeremy was in a rush to get out of the hospital as quickly as possible so he could get back to work, so he agreed to skip a less invasive test and go straight to esophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, the EGD revealed a large tumor, which the doctors determined to be adenocarcinoma. His diet caused severe acid reflux, which made his esophagus the perfect breeding ground for cancer. They planned an esophagectomy, which involved removing part of his esophagus along with the tumor and replacing it with part of his colon. However, shortly after they started his surgery, he coded and was unable to be resuscitated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHer father, Jeremy, was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and had to have surgery to treat that. However, he unfortunately coded and died during that surgery. When Erin and her mother were informed of his death, they clung to each other and cried.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She plays volleyball.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weaver, Erin}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
