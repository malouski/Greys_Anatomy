He was almost adopted into one family with two siblings in June 2002, until due to an old faulty oven the house caught fire, killing his parents and separating him from his brother and sister. After a while, he ended up in a group home with a lot of other kids, who became his family until he joined the Seattle Fire Department and found his family there. During his time in the group home, he had night terrors, which freaked out all the kids except one girl.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], 2x04 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Leadership Changes at Station 19===\n[[Tiffany (Stuck)|Tiffany's]] house caught on fire when her laptop cord sparked on her bed while she was in the bathroom. Station 19 responded to the fire. Pruitt sent Maya and Andy in to do search and rescue while Dean, Jack, and Travis put out the fire. Maya and Andy quickly found Tiffany and brought her outside, where she said Charlie was still inside. With the fire extinguisher, they searched for Charlie and quickly found a puppy. Dean carried Charlie out and handed him over to a grateful Tiffany.<ref>[[Stuck]], 1x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhile fighting an apartment fire, Jack and Pruitt got separated when Jack entered a kid's room to look for a child. When he came back out, he couldn't find Pruitt because of the smoke. He had to tell Andy he couldn't find her dad and she and Maya came to help look for him. They found him on the floor, unconscious and pulseless. They tried to take him out, but they noticed the fire was choking, so they couldn't go out of the apartment. Once Andy got a pulse on her father, they strapped him to Jack and the four of them jumped out the window onto landing pads. Pruitt was then taken to [[Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital]], where he had surgery and then was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He knew he had to step down as Captain immediately. He said Jack could be in charge until they filled the job. When Andy protested that, he promoted her to lieutenant and said they could share the responsibilities until a new captain was officially chosen.<ref>[[Stuck]], 1x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nFrankel came to the station and explained to Jack and Andy the procedure for choosing a new captain, which would take months. She said they'd alternate as captain each shift until then. Andy went first. She had the team do air consumption drills with new partners. Frankel watched for a while and then said she could stop back in anytime.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], 1x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 got called out to Stratford Middle School, where someone had pulled the fire alarm. [[Principal Linsley]] met them and said it was likely a false alarm. They said they'd won as quickly as they could to clear the building and get the kids back inside. They went through the building and found the alarm that had been pulled. They turned off the alarm and went to continue their sweep, but Ben found Tuck still inside the building. He followed Tuck and saw that he was the one who had pulled the alarm. He needed to get Ben to the school for his friend Ava, who was pregnant and in labor. He did everything he knew to do but still needed help. Ben and Vic delivered Ava's baby and after a brief complication when the amniotic sac didn't rupture, Ava and the baby were both healthy and stable.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], 1x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen a crash caused a tanker to overturn, Station 19 responded. Dean and Travis had to pry [[Shawn (Invisible to Me)|Shawn]] out of his car while Vic and Ben worked on the truck driver, who had gotten out of the cab and fallen. They noticed it was hot around them just as Andy realized it was an ethanol fire. It was surrounding Ben and Vic and they didn't have enough foam to put it out. Vic and Ben couldn't get out without leaving the truck driver there to die. They got him as wet and cool as they could as they treated him and then conserved their air while the rest of the team tried to figure out how to get them out. Andy eventually decided to back the truck over the flames to get them out and drive it back out.<ref>[[Invisible to Me]], 1x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter Ben and Dean discovered that The Langham was on fire, they called the rest of the team in to help and started an evacuation. When the team arrived, they went up to the roof. They located the flame under the roof and created a ventilation hole, despite Jack wanting to make a strip. The hole wasn't sufficient to make the fire die down, so Andy authorized them to cut a strip. The strip worked and the fire started to die down. They got off the roof less than a minute before the roof collapsed. Back on the ground, Frankel admonished both Jack and Andy for their choices, saying Andy should have listened to Jack's experience and Jack should have followed orders.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], 1x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 also responded to a medical call. [[Dallas]] called the police after her brother and friends wouldn't wake up when she pulled them out of the pool. They'd made ice cream with liquid nitrogen and poured the rest in the pool to make it look cool. They were able to get the kids all breathing again, but then Jack suddenly jumped into the pool. He emerged with another kid that Dallas thought had gone home. They got her breathing as well and Dallas went to give them numbers to contact parents, but she had trouble breathing and vomited. She was dry drowning. She was put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital.\n\nLater, when Jack submitted an incident report for the pool party call, Frankel talked to him about the adversity she'd faced and the respect she earned. She shared a concern that Andy had been handed things. Jack corrected her that Andy hadn't had anything handed to her and if anything, her father held her back.<ref>[[Contain the Flame]], 1x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe team responded to a fire at a B&B on Sunken Meadow Road. Ben and Vic laid out the hoses, but before they could take them into the fire, a neighbor drove over one and popped it. They went to get a replacement line, but it turned out to be unnecessary because the fire was small and contained to the stovetop.\n\nThey later returned to the Inn when the fire reignited and engulfed the building in flames. When a fire reignited in her face, Vic started to have a panic attack and Ben pulled her out while Andy doused the flames. Outside, Vic's ear was treated where it had been burned. Inside, Andy heard popping. She tried to go toward where she heard Deborah, but there were exploding wine bottles between them. They looked for the fuel that was feeding the fire to stop it off while Andy ran past the bottles to get to Deborah. Andy tied off her leg above a wound and then helped her out, using a tray as a shield from the glass. They were able to turn off the gas to the house, to keep it from reigniting. Once they got Deborah out, they realized she'd inhaled some glass. They couldn't intubate, so they did a crike and got her breathing again. Then they took her to the hospital.<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lynn (Station 19)|Lynn]] came into the station to have her car seats installed, Pruitt pressured Jack to do it personally.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S19)|Shock to the System]], 1x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe team was called out for a fire, but it turned out to be a small e-cigarette fire and they were back at the station quickly.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S19)|Shock to the System]], 1x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nThey were later called out again for a car accident involving downed electrical wires. They found [[Marshall]] trapped in his car with live wires around him. They moved the wires as they waited for the power to be shut off so they could get Marshall out of the car. However, when Vic noticed a fuel leak under his car, they were rushed, knowing that if a power line hit the gas, it would burst into flames and kill Marshall. So they coached him through hopping and landing with both feet simultaneously outside the car. Then he had to hop a few more times to safety. As he went to hop, a line snapped behind him, startling him, so he landed on his face instead of on his feet. The power was shut off soon after, but he was electrocuted severely. They attempted to resuscitate him, but they quickly realized the damage was too severe, so they had him call his wife, who was pregnant with triplets, one last time, and tell her he loved her and their babies.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S19)|Shock to the System]], 1x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nAndy and Jack carpooled to The Incinerator, a test to determine one's suitability to be Captain. They arrived surprised to find so many candidates and only one open spot. They were put in a group with [[Charlotte Dearborn]] and [[Cole Edmonds]] to take the test. Cole went first and expected the women to watch while he and Jack did the rescue and talked down to them. Next was Charlotte, who was cavalier about safety, though she set a record time. During Jack's turn, they put out the fire, but after multiple sweeps, they didn't find the dummy, so Jack made the decision to leave without it. On the outside, he was informed that very few people mastered that variation of the test and there was no dummy in the first place. Finally, it was Andy's turn. She emphasized them working as a team. She had them hold on to each other due to low visibility. The building started to creak as they crawled along and eventually, the roof collapsed, separating them. Cole didn't respond to her calls, so they had to find him. He was unconscious. Charlotte then called for a mayday over Andy's objections. Frankel ordered everyone out, but Andy decided to stay in and find the dummy. Jack stayed with her and they retrieved the dummy. Once they were out, Frankel berated Andy for her decision to ignore the mayday call. Ripley interrupted and said he understood Andy's call, but they have rules for a reason. It's a Captain's job to remember that. In a real call, they'd all have come out in body bags. He understood but didn't agree with, her call. On the way home, Jack said he needed to win it because he was still in it, but Andy refused to talk to him about it.<ref>[[Stronger Together]], 1x06 (S19)</ref>\n\nDuring a shift when Andy was supposed to be Captain, Jack had to step in when Andy accompanied her father to the hospital.\n\nA fire started at Flanner's restaurant and quickly spread to the rest of the strip mall. Station 19 was called to\u00a0respond.\u00a0Jack rushed in to evacuate people, followed by Ryan, despite Ryan not wearing turnout gear. They evacuated all the survivors they could quickly while Maya, Dean, Vic, and Travis set up the lines to douse the fire. Once the structure became too unstable to continue, they prepared to start the water and ended evacuations. They then noticed a woman on the balcony holding a baby. Jack took the ladder from the engine over to her, but it took time and so Ryan asked the woman to toss down her baby, so she'd be ready to jump to Jack when he got close enough. After some hesitation, she tossed down her baby and he caught it. Then she was able to jump onto the ladder with Jack and was taken safely to the ground. Jack and Ryan shook hands and each agreed that the other had done good work.<ref>[[Let It Burn]], 1x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhile Andy was captain, they were called out to respond to Peter, who accidentally ran into a dumpster. On their way to the hospital, they came across a party bus that had crashed. Andy left Jack to monitor Peter while they helped the party bus victims. While they were waiting, Peter offered up the gurney he was on for them to use, so Jack left briefly to take it to them. While he was gone, Peter ransacked the ambulance looking for morphine. During the ensuing struggle with Jack, Peter put his hand through a pane of glass and degloved his finger. Jack, with Dean's help, was able to restrain him and bandage his hand before they were able to take him to the hospital.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], 1x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nDespite being on an active call, Andy decided to have her team stop to help the victims of a crashed party bus because the responding station was still eight minutes away. They had to free [[Susan]], who was impaled on a piece of the bus, and [[Carla]], who was pinned under the bus, while also treating [[Mary (Every Second Counts)|Mary]] and the other six victims who were free. They were able to get everyone out and stabilized before station 23 arrived to take over.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], 1x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe station responded to a fire at the house of [[Audrey (Hot Box)|Audrey]] and [[Oliver (Hot Box)|Oliver]]. The fire started in a fireplace and was mostly contained to that area of the house. In order to put out the fire, they needed to go through the garage to get to the innermost part of the house. Audrey tried to get them access, but her blistered finger meant the pad couldn't read her print. Dean was sent to put the override code in, but he forgot the code and couldn't radio out because his radio was on the wrong channel, so after two failed attempts, the others were locked in the garage with no way out. With the fire in the house, the garage started to heat up. They searched for anything they could use to try to free themselves. They found a toolkit, which Karen used to pick the lock on the trunk of the car and retrieve a jack. They tried to use the jack to lift the garage door, but it wouldn't budge. As the temperature climbed, Ryan decided to hotwire the car and try to use it as a battering ram. Jack said it was a bad idea, but Ryan started it anyway. Andy was able to stop him before he moved the car. Jack had the idea to use the motor from the internal door to get access to the house. It didn't work and they started to wear out. When Pruitt arrived and gave Andy a pep talk, she used the last of her energy to think of a plan. She saw the water heater and decided they could use the pilot light to create an explosion. They siphoned gas from the car and rigged the water heater up to explode and propel itself through the garage door. It worked and once they were free, they were all cooled down and rehydrated.\n\nWhen Jack later asked Dean what happened with the access pad, Vic covered for him and he assured her there wouldn't be\u00a0a next time.<ref>[[Hot Box]], 1x09 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhile Jack was waiting for his final captain interview, a page came in about a skyscraper fire downtown, so Ripley said the interviews were being postponed until further notice. He then told Andy that if he didn't get captain, he was putting in for a transfer to another station.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], 1x10 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Skyscraper Fire, PTSD, and New Captain===\nStation 19 anxiously waited to be called in on the skyscraper fire. While they waited, they checked their supplies. When they were finally called in, they responded to the fire and went to base camp to receive their assignments. Most of the team was sent to relieve station 7 working on the active fire, but Ben and Travis were kept for triage and Maya and Vic were sent above the fire to do crowd control at a law firm where they were keeping civilians held in place. At the active fire, they worked with Charlotte, who made the decision to jump through the fire to try to get to a fire door. Then there was a crash and she didn't respond. Andy jumped after her and found her injured. She used an extinguisher sphere to put out the flames and let the rest of the group come help her free Charlotte. Andy took Charlotte down to triage and because the fire was contained, she sent Jack and Dean to the floor above to check it out. On that floor, they found a large number of combustibles. A rapid evacuation was started. Andy dropped Charlotte at triage and then went back up to the top floor to tell them to get ready for evacuation. Then she went back downstairs and helped Ripley pack up and evacuate base camp. When Jack and Dean found a civilian as they closed fire doors, they called for an elevator evacuation. Ripley said no, but Andy took the elevator key and sent the elevator up. Jack sent Dean down with the civilian and continued his work. He talked to Andy through the elevator shaft. She tried to convince him to find a way out, but he said he wasn't willing to sacrifice the lives of anyone on the team to try to save himself. She asked him to stay on the radio, which he did until it cut out a few minutes later. Then there was an explosion in the building.<ref>[[Not Your Hero]], 1x10 (S19)</ref>\n\nJack was trapped under a pile of debris which was getting hotter and hotter. He was stuck there for so long without being able to move that his PASS device activated. He thought he was going to die. Andy and Maya went up to the floor where he was and pried open a door to get access. They then followed the sound of his PASS device to find him. They pulled the rubble off him and the three of them evacuated the building together. Outside, Andy evaluated Jack, who insisted that he was okay.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nSix weeks after the skyscraper fire, the team gathered at the station to meet their new captain. Ripley introduced them to [[Robert Sullivan]], who immediately established himself as a strict, by the book boss. He said he wanted to improve station 19's efficiency and wanted to start immediately.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 was called out to help when [[Max Forrester]] fell into a storm drain after disappearing from the hospital. Ben, who had been left behind at the station due to a burn on his hand, was aided by Travis and Pruitt as he located plans for the storm drains' paths to see where Max was most likely to have gone. Station 23 had a feed down a drain that showed a handprint, giving them a clue where he'd gone. They quickly moved downstream from that location and Maya prepared to jump in to grab Max. However, her oxygen tank wasn't working, so they went to get a replacement tank. While she was gone, Andy heard Max's voice down below them. Over Maya and Sullivan's objections, Andy jumped down into the drain to try to get to him. However, the flow of water picked up and while she was pulled underwater, Max was swept away. Since they'd lost that chance to get him, they had only one more access point down the line. When they arrived, they learned that the opening was smaller than they expected, too small for an adult to fit down to get him. When they heard Max down below them, they considered using a jackhammer to widen the opening, but Ben found that there was a gas line near them and it's too risky. Since they couldn't get an adult down into the drain, they decided to send down a loop for Max to grab. Max was scared to let go and jump to the loop, even when his father told him to. His father finally told him that his mother was dying and encouraged him as he jumped and grabbed the loop. Max was then lifted to safety.<ref>[[Under the Surface]], 2x02 (S19)</ref>\n\nIn order to foster cooperation between the fire department and police department, Sullivan sent Jack on a ride-along with Ryan. Ryan told Jack he wasn't allowed to leave the squad car for any reason because he was a civilian. They were on traffic duty. They first pulled over [[Vince (Home To Hold Onto)|Vince]], who was speeding to get home because he had burned himself on hot coffee and wasn't wearing pants or underwear. Jack used the megaphone to ask Vince about his burn and then advised him that he'd need medical attention and offered a police escort to the hospital. After that was complete, Ryan pulled over [[Gregory Dougal]], who was also speeding. He said he was on the way to a birthday party with his daughter, [[Lindy Dougal|Lindy]]. Ryan said he'd be right back and went back to the squad car. He immediately radioed in to say he suspected a child abduction. Jack was shocked that Ryan had figured that out based just on the traffic stop. Ryan pointed out what he'd seen and confirmed that there was an Amber alert out for Lindy, who was the subject of a custody dispute. They waited for backup, but when Gregory clearly became restless, Ryan went over to the car and calmly told him not to do what he was planning because it wouldn't end well for him. He was able to talk Gregory into surrendering. Jack sat with Lindy until her mom came. The mom thanked him, even though he tried to tell her that Ryan was actually the hero. When Jack told Ryan about that, he said he's used to it because cops aren't seen as heroes like firefighters are.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], 2x03 (S19)</ref>\n\nStation 19 was called out to a structure fire. When they arrived, they started a perimeter sweep to see if anyone might be inside and prepared to start fighting the fire. When Maya learned that the hydrant was dry because the building was scheduled for demolition, she suggested that once they cleared the building, they could use the water in the engine to drown the surrounding buildings and let it burn. Jack then saw signs that there were squatters inside. Just then a kid came out of the building with [[Zoe]]. He was handed off to be seen and Zoe tried to re-enter the building. Andy stopped her, saying she needed to be treated, too, but Zoe said there were five more kids inside. They found [[Sean (Lost and Found)|Sean]] and he was evacuated and treated. Andy then noticed a sprinkler system and said they needed to locate the valve. Zoe thought she knew where it was and showed Andy the way to it. Andy reached the valve just as Travis and Ben noticed that what was coming out of the sprinklers was flammable. She didn't get the warning in time and turned on the sprinklers, which caused fire to engulf the building. Dean and Vic ended up trapped with two kids and Andy ended up trapped with Zoe as well. Vic and Dean shared their oxygen with the kids until an exit was made and they were able to evacuate. Ben, Travis, and Andy remained trapped. Water was then finally available and they doused the building as quickly as they could. Everyone was evacuated and treated for smoke inhalation.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], 2x04 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe firefighters of station 19 held a training session for the police officers, teaching them first aid and CPR. Maya was paired with Jack to teach one group, which included [[Elle Kingsley]]. They both flirted with her and spent the whole day trying to outdo each other for her affection. When Sullivan saw them laughing and felt they weren't taking it seriously, he called Maya out on it, which eventually got him sent home for the rest of the shift. At the end of the day, both Jack and Maya got Elle's number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nUpon learning it was Dean's birthday, Jack planned a surprise birthday party with the rest of the team. They ate cake and celebrated.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nJack continued to have trouble sleeping and what little sleep he got was plagued by nightmares of being trapped in the skyscraper.<ref>[[Last Day on Earth]], 2x06 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter separating from Miranda, Ben wanted to feel a sense of togetherness, so he planned \"Friendsgiving\" with Jack at Dean's houseboat and invited the rest of the team. However, while they were still preparing the meal, the team was called away due to accidents from the windstorm.\n\nAt the station, they went over storm protocols and gathered extra supplies to be ready. Andy and Sullivan were soon after called out for a car accident, then Greg, Ryan, Pruitt, and Grant surprised the team by bringing Friendsgiving to the station. Meal prep continued, but another call came in and Ben, Dean, Travis, Maya, Vic, and Ripley headed out to cover it, leaving Jack alone at the station, where he played poker with the others and anxiously waited for news. At the end of the day, he got into a spat with Pruitt after Pruitt expressed concern about Jack's lack of sleep. When the team returned to the station, they all sat down to eat. At the table, Ripley announced that Maya would be a lieutenant soon and he already put her in for a transfer to station 23.<ref>[[Weather the Storm]], 2x07 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter being called out by Pruitt for not getting Jack help, Dean used the ruse of cleanup duty to get Jack to go to the kitchen, where they held an intervention. He lashed out at them but was interrupted by Ripley, coming to tell them they were taking calls again and their first call was search and rescue for Andy and Sullivan as no one had heard anything from them in over an hour. They all suited up. Ripley was called back to headquarters, so Pruitt stepped in as captain. Pruitt then benched Jack, left Travis to keep an eye on him, and they left to find Andy. Jack then quickly left the station and wouldn't answer his phone.\n\nJack went to four months of therapy three times a week. He said he felt ready to go back to work, but she said he needed to deal with whatever was still keeping him up at night. He was still not speaking to Dean because he felt like Dean had betrayed him. Maya met Jack after every single therapy session, even though he said it wasn't necessary.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], 2x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nJack was finally cleared to go back to work, though he was still fighting with Dean. After months of rehab, Sullivan was also ready to go back to work. Pruitt criticized him for missing Jack's PTSD and not seeing that regular drop-ins weren't coming in anymore. This inspired Sullivan to take Ben and Jack for a wellness check on a drop-in Pruitt specifically mentioned. They went to his house and did an exam. He revealed that Sullivan was the reason he stopped checking in. His car was busted, leaving him unable to pick up his medications. Ben then heard regurgitation in his heart. He didn't want to go to the hospital, but he collapsed trying to fight them off. Sullivan distracted him with a game of chess as they worked to get him stable while they waited for an aid car. He stabilized, then checkmated Sullivan. After they sent him to the hospital, they remembered that he mentioned his car wasn't working, so they went to his garage and fixed it.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], 2x09 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Hooking Up with Maya===\nMaya and Jack were called out to the transit tunnel for an unknown medical emergency. They arrived to learn that a subway had malfunctioned and multiple passengers were injured in a minor fall. Once they boarded the car, they started treating the injuries, which all seemed minor. One of the injured was [[Will (Crazy Train)|Will]], who didn't want to let Maya check him out, but agreed when Maya asked directly. She examined him and asked about his cough, but his father didn't know how long he'd had it. Will coughed up blood and Maya noticed that he'd been on an international flight. He'd come from Bashran, in the middle east. Maya consulted with Jack and said she believed they were dealing with a contagious illness and needed to go on lockdown. They radioed out for CDC, which confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in Bashran and said they'd be on their way. They also noted that another passenger, [[Neil]], had come in on the same flight. They talked to Will's father and explained the situation and then made an announcement to the whole car. While they were working, Maya told Jack that she believed he had lied about being fine to get back to work. The situation escalated when Neil's condition worsened and he collapsed on the floor. They put in an IV and used lidocaine to restore sinus rhythm. He stabilized, but then Will collapsed. While Maya and Jack were distracted, [[Reese]] tried to leave, but [[Kenneth]], a security guard, used a taser on him, which set off a cardiac episode. He took the heart monitor off Neil and put it on Reese, which revealed ventricular arrhythmia. They didn't have any more lidocaine to treat him, so Maya went through the Aid Car, asking the passengers to show her any medications they had. While she was working on that, Reese flatlined and Neil stopped breathing. Jack asked the passengers to help and handed out assignments. They were able to stabilize Reese but realized Will needed blood. Desperate, Jack used Harold as a donor for his own son. After a rough moment, all the patients were stable. The CDC then arrived and set up decontamination so all the passengers could leave. Jack and Maya's tests showed that they weren't infected. After being decontaminated, the two of them went back to Maya's place and had sex in her shower.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], 2x10 (S19)</ref>\n\nStill upset with Dean for his part in the intervention, Jack called Dean's family and set up a dinner with them.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], 2x09 (S19)</ref> However, before the dinner could happen, Dean's family canceled and Jack was trying to reschedule.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], 2x10 (S19)</ref>\n\nFinally, Jack was able to reschedule the dinner. Ifeya, Bill, and Yemi Miller came over. Ifeya and Bill continued to try to pressure Dean to quit firefighting and join the family business. He said he wouldn't and after Yemi, inspired by Dean, told them she wanted to move out of their house, Ifeya insisted on speaking to Dean alone. He told her about how firefighting is more than just a job to him and got her to give Yemi the same support she gave him by agreeing to go on a few dates she set up. After the dinner, Dean proclaimed Jack an honorary Miller.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], 2x11 (S19)</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nJack knows how to get things done and isn't usually afraid to break the rules in order to save people. Jack is caring, passionate, and energetic especially when it comes to Andy Herrera.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\n====[[Andy Herrera]]====\nJack and Andy secretly began sleeping together. When she found an engagement ring while they were having sex, she freaked out. Later, when Jack lost Pruitt while they were in a fire together, Andy got angry with him. With Pruitt stepping down, Jack and Andy had to work as co-captains together, further straining the relationship.<ref>[[Stuck]], 1x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nThe two continuously bickered because of their different leadership styles, but\u00a0they began sleeping with each other again after a while to relieve the tension and postpone the conversation they knew they needed to have. He decided that sex was not enough for him and that he wanted more, to build a home with someone. Andy said she didn't want more and that the team and the station were her home. As they were arguing over this, they failed to properly dress and Pruitt caught them when he came to fetch documents from the captain's office.<ref>[[Reignited]], 1x04 (S19)</ref> Under pressure from Pruitt, they told the team about their relationship. The team was mostly supportive but only worried about who they'd saved first in a fire. Their worries were abated when Jack and Andy said they'd ended things.<ref>[[Shock to the System (S19)|Shock to the System]], 1x05 (S19)</ref>\n\n====[[Elle Kingsley]]====\nJack flirted with Elle at a training for police officers and spent the day competing with Maya for her affection. At the end of the day, both he and Maya got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref>\n\n====[[Maya Bishop]]====\nMaya and Jack first met on Maya and Andy's first day at Station 19. Jack jokingly asked if he could touch Maya's Olympic Gold Medal for luck, but Maya immediately refused, telling him it wasn't luck but hard work and it proved how much better she was than him. Then, Maya and Andy both agreed that Jack was \"very ew\".<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref> Maya was the only person who knew about Jack and Andy's secret relationship, the latter's proposal, and their subsequent breakup. She was often antagonistic towards Jack, making smack talk about him behind his back and she had clearly sided with Andy during the captain's race.<ref>[[Stuck]], 1x01 (S19)</ref> However, when Andy and Jack got back together, Maya didn't know and was hurt when she found out, thinking Andy had betrayed her, but the girls resolved their differences.<ref>[[Shock to the System]], 1x05 (S19)</ref> Later, at the skyscraper, Maya helped Andy look for Jack.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter the skyscraper and the end of Andy and Jack's relationship, Maya and Jack were often seen bickering and throwing light-hearted insults at each other. When Ripley revealed that Maya had applied to be a lieutenant, Jack told her he was ready to take her on if she tried to take his job since there could only be two lieutenants at the station. At the police training, they worked together and competed for the attention of policewoman [[Elle Kingsley]], and eventually both got her number.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...|Do A Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref> When Pruitt drew everyone's attention to Jack's PTSD, Maya participated in the intervention. However, Jack got angry at everyone and told Maya she had no chance to take his job from him. When the team went to look for Herrera and Sullivan, Pruitt as acting captain benched Jack and ordered Maya to act as temporary lieutenant. Four months after the windstorm, Maya was meeting Jack after every therapy session and showing her support, telling him he would eventually return to active duty. She also invited him to Andy's party, but he declined.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], 2x08 (S19)</ref>\n\nMaya and Jack were both on Aid Car during the next shift, but Maya didn't think that Jack was ready to be back to work. The two responded to the train crash which turned into an infectious disease call and even though they were arguing in the beginning, they later started working together to treat the patients. Afterwards, while waiting to be cleared, the two resolved their differences and later had sex while showering at Maya's apartment.<ref>[[Crazy Train]], 2x10 (S19)</ref> While Jack wanted to clear things up between them, Maya told him she was telling Andy about what had happened and that nothing would happen between them ever again. However, when Maya tried to tell Andy, they were interrupted by Ryan and his date.<ref>[[Baby Boom]], 2x11 (S19)</ref>\n\nLater, Maya noticed that Jack was doing the quiet thing, meaning he was angry and out of concern, she asked what happened. Jack told her that seeing Dean with his family brought up feelings about his own and he told Maya that he didn't actually know who his biological parents were. Maya tried helping him by suggesting he internet-stalk them, but he brushed her off and told her he didn't want her help. However, Maya still cared and she told him so on the rooftop of the station, adding that he was the last person she expected to care about. She then walked away, but turned around and kissed him passionately.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], 2x12 (S19)</ref> The two then continued to hook up in secret. While having beer for breakfast after shift at the houseboat, Miller asked Jack to point out why Maya would make a terrible fake girlfriend for him, but Jack simply complimented Maya, saying that \"her eyes sparkle even in the dark\", proving he also had feelings for her.<ref>[[The Dark Night]], 2x13 (S19)</ref>\n\nWhen Andy brought up the fact that she and Jack were on good terms, Jack went to Maya and told her they needed to tell Andy, but Maya suggested they have a last secret hookup in a supply closet before telling Andy the truth. However, Andy found them and she and Maya got into a big argument about it as Andy felt humiliated.<ref>[[Friendly Fire]], 2x14 (S19)</ref> During overhaul at the coffee processing plant, Dean revealed that he knew about Maya and Jack as they often snuck in and out of the houseboat and Maya was eager to talk to someone about all of her feelings as Andy was still mad at her.<ref>[[Always Ready]], 2x15 (S19)</ref> \n\nAfter Ripley died, Maya was visibly sad and constantly crying and Jack tried to ask her what was going on, but Maya denied the fact that she was crying. Later, Dean used an analogy with sea anemones to explain their behavior to them why Maya was crying and the fact that Jack wasn't actually annoyed with her as well as the fact that the two didn't know how to act now that they were officially together. At the funeral, Maya held Jack's hand during Sullivan's eulogy.<ref>[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]], 2x16 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter the bar crash, Maya sat down with Jack and told him he is good in bed and he is a good guy. He caught on to what Maya was intending. He asked if it was because she was interested in getting promoted to captain. She neglected to answer the question. She said they should just be friends.<ref>[[I Know This Bar]], 3x01 (S19)</ref>\n\n====[[Inara]]====\n\n\n===Familial===\nHis most recent foster parents got married after 6 months of dating.<ref>[[When It Rains, It Pours!]], 2x12 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Friendships===\n====[[Dean Miller]]====\nJack met Dean at the fire academy. Dean helped Jack get through Hazardous Materials and Jack helped Dean get through Resource Deployment. Their friendship has remained strong.<ref>[[Every Second Counts]], 1x08 (S19)</ref> During their time at the academy, they initially didn't get along and even ended up getting in a physical fight, which nearly got them kicked out.<ref>[[No Recovery]], 2x01 (S19)</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Dean lives on the water, Jack was surprised Dean had never invited him over before.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], 2x03 (S19)</ref> When Dean learned that Jack had grown up in foster care, he was upset that Jack hadn't told him before, but then asked Jack to move in with him, believing that that's what Jack wanted all along.<ref>[[Lost and Found]], 2x04 (S19)</ref> After Jack moved in, Dean woke up to find Jack rearranging the furniture.<ref>[[Do a Little Harm...]], 2x05 (S19)</ref>\n\nHe became angry with Dean when Dean told Pruitt about his PTSD. This led to him not speaking to Dean for months.<ref>[[Crash and Burn]], 2x08 (S19)</ref> When he finally returned to work, he spoke to Dean only to tell him that he'd called Dean's family and made them talk to him, as payback for what Dean had done.<ref>[[I Fought the Law]], 2x09 (S19)</ref>\n\n====[[Ryan Tanner]]====\nAfter Jack went on a ride-along with Ryan, they buried the hatchet and went to Dean's after work to share a drink and hang out.<ref>[[Home To Hold Onto]], 2x03 (S19)</ref>\n\n===Professional===\n====[[Pruitt Herrera]]====\nPruitt was Jack's mentor.\n\n==Career==\nJack is a Lieutenant at [[SFD Station 19|Station 19]] of the [[Seattle Fire Department]].\n\nAfter Pruitt Herrera was diagnosed with cancer, Jack and Andy became the acting captains of Station 19, with one of them running each shift.
