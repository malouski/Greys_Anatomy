George went in to try to get her to leave and go to Sugar Maple Nursing Home, where her room was waiting, but she was extremely stubborn and insisted that she be allowed to stay in the hospital until the room her daughter was converting into her bedroom was ready for her.\n\nGeorge started to look into ways she could stay, but [[Richard Webber]] said she couldn't stay on surgical service, so George sent her to gynecology to check for a prolapsed uterus. However, she was quickly sent back to her room because having a hysterectomy in 1974 meant she couldn't possibly have a prolapsed uterus.\n\nSophie said she was feeling feverish, but her temperature was normal. George said he'd have to call her daughter, but felt her forehead.\n\nGeorge then sent her to infectious diseases, saying he suspected West Nile Virus. They did a spinal tap to test her, but when her daughter arrived, she revealed that Sophie had been lying and she wasn't remodeling her house so her mother could live with her. When George confronted her, she said she was worried that going to the nursing home would make her old. George assured her that wasn't possible.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nShe has a daughter whom she said was converting her den for Sophie to live in. However, this was later revealed to be false.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 78 at the time of her hip replacement.\n*She had a hysterectomy in 1974.\n*She sang for the troops.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n2x14-1.JPG\n2x14-2.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Larson, Sophie}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (OB/GYN)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ID)]]"}}}]}}}}
