As an adult, she mainly remembered that it was hot and that her mother took her to cool off her feet in the Reflecting Pool.\n\n===Protests===\nNell spent much of her life protesting, including in Ferguson, in response to the death of Michael Brown, and at Standing Rock, protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. After the death of George Floyd, she protested in Seattle. During this protest, she was hit with a tear gas canister fired at close range. She was taken to the hospital, where they removed the canister in surgery after determining that it had only torn through muscle and hadn't hit any major vessels. After her surgery, she was told they'd go back in in a few days to close her up more neatly so her scarring would be minimal, but she showed them her other scars and said it would just go along with them. They also said she'd need physical therapy to regain complete range of motion.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She tore her ACL running from a tank in Ferguson and got frostbite on her hand at Standing Rock.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n17x12-17.jpg\n17x12-18.jpg\n17x12-19.jpg\n17x12-20.jpg\n17x12-21.jpg\n17x12-22.jpg\n17x12-23.jpg\n17x12-24.jpg\n17x12-25.jpg\n17x12-26.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Timms, Nell}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]"}}}]}}}}
