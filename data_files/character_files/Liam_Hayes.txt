She underwent treatment, including two clinical trials, but they were unsuccessful and she died. After she died, they gathered up her things from her hospital room and sat in the empty room together for a while before going home.

''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\nFollowing the death of George Floyd, Liam and Austin painted signs and went to the protests with their father. While they were protesting, one of the counter-protesters, a Nazi, came at one of them with a billy club. Cormac got between them and took a blow to the head, so they left to go to the hospital so he could be treated. Cormac then sent his sons home, barring them from attending any more protests. However, after a day of work and treating [[Nell Timms]], Cormac went home and told his sons that he believed the work they were doing was important and they should be part of it, but only during the daytime and only while he was there.
