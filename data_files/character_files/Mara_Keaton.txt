Jackson, unfortunately believing this to be a romantic set-up by his mother, rejected Dr. Keaton. Offended by this presumption, Dr. Keaton then revealed her true intentions with Jackson, and the two eventually bonded over their mutual frustrations with Jackson's mother.\n\nWith Jackson's advice, Dr. Keaton stood up to Dr. Avery prior to the Frontiers of Medicine Benefit and informed her that she would be taking the night off. Dr. Keaton and Jackson then spent the night together in an [[On-Call Room|on-call room]].\n\n==Career==\nDr. Keaton attained her medical degree from the Medical Sciences Division at the University of Oxford and completed her [[Surgery#Surgical Specialties|surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. She then attained a [[Urology|urology]] [[Fellow|fellowship]] at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] to study under [[Catherine Fox|Dr. Catherine Avery]].\n\nAt Dr. Keaton's [[One Step Too Far|introduction]], she was in the final year of her fellowship and is considering [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] to be an [[Attending|attending]] urologist the following year.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Dr. Keaton wore her [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] lab coat when she visited [[Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital]] with [[Catherine Fox|Dr. Avery]].\n*Dr. Keaton is British.\n*Dr. Keaton's father is the Director of Surgical Science at Oxford.\n*Dr. Keaton is aware of [[Derek Shepherd|Derek Shepherd's]] world-class [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] reputation.\n*It's unknown if Dr. Keaton completed a [[General Surgery|general surgical]] [[Resident|residency]] or a [[Urology|urological surgical]] residency. Given that she was introduced as just a urology [[Fellow|fellow]], it's most likely the former.\n*When Dr. Keaton entered the [[Operating Room|OR]] where [[Catherine Fox|Dr. Avery]], [[Richard Webber|Dr. Webber]], and [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Bailey]] were performing surgery, Dr. Keaton was wearing light blue scrubs instead of navy scrubs and had no personalized scrub cap.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" bordersize=\"none\" spacing=\"small\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n8x17-1.png\n8x17-5.png\n8x17-13.png\n8x17-22.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keaton, Mara}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
