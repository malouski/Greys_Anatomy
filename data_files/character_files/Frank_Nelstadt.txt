He'd had the cough for a few days and wasn't concerned, but Ella was worried and made him go to the hospital. While he was being examined, he had trouble breathing, which was resolved when he coughed up a blood clot which was shaped like a bronchial tree. When he started to struggle to breathe again, he was taken to have TPA injected to break up the clot. He was then diagnosed with Factor V leiden. As the condition is genetic, Frank's husband, [[Danny Nelstadt|Danny]], immediately said Ella needed to be tested. They never wanted to know which of them was her biological father, but knew they needed to know if she had the same kind of condition, so she could properly maintain her health. The test came back positive, though Ella said it didn't matter because they're both her dads.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Danny Nelstadt]].\n\n===Familial===\nHe and his husband have one daughter. When they had her, they chose not to know which of them was the biological father, unless she eventually wanted to know.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 47 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nelstadt, Frank}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]"}}}]}}}}
