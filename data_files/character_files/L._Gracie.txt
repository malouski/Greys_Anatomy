Gracie''' was a surgeon at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]] in the early 80s.\n\n==History==\nGracie treated [[Phillip Nichols]] when he first came to the hospital with a hernia. When Phillip started getting worse instead of better, Gracie challenged the residents to figure out what was wrong with him. [[Ellis Grey]] and [[Richard Webber]] found out he had cryptococcus and thought he might have gotten it because he had what was then known as GRID (now AIDS). Gracie chastised them for implying that the patient might be gay. When Phillip later came back with Kaposi's Sarcoma and an intussusception, Gracie refused to operate because Phillip had AIDS.\n\n==Career==\nHe was an attending general surgeon at Seattle Grace Hospital in the early 80s.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gracie, L.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
