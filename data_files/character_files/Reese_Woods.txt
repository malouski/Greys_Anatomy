Her parents, desperate to help her, conceived another child, [[Donna Woods|Donna]], to provide bone marrow for a transplant. From then on, Donna provided anything that Reese needed. Because she was sick for so much of her childhood, Reese became somewhat of a daredevil, taking risks and repeatedly seriously injuring herself.\n\n===Hang Gliding Accident===\nWhile hang gliding over Tiger Mountain, Reese got in an accident. She broke her tibia and complained of abdominal pain. Her sister said she didn\u2019t want to watch Reese kill herself, but Reese insisted that it was just a break and she would be fine. When Callie observed that the broken tibia was not a bone, but a rod, Donna informed her that the rod had been inserted in March after a skiing accident. Donna also stated that Reese has broken both forearms, lost a kidney, and dislocated her shoulder. She says she\u2019s making up for lost time.\n\nIn surgery, Callie noted that the rod caused a lot of bleeding which would take a long time to fix. Owen said that it was looking like the kidney wasn\u2019t going to be saved, so the sister would likely be donating hers.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\n====[[Donna Woods]]====\nHer sister, Donna, was conceived to save her life and continues to be in charge of her, despite Reese being the elder of the two. Reese believes that Donna treats her like Reese is her child.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*She was 22 at the time of her hang gliding accident.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Woods, Reese}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Transplant)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Renal)]]"}}}]}}}}
