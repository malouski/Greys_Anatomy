When the paramedics arrived, they were unable to find a pulse on Hattie and assumed she was dead, so they tried to get Norris to let her go so they could take him to the hospital, but he refused to let go, forcing them to take both of them in the ambulance on the same gurney. Once they arrived at the hospital, [[Meredith Grey]] talked to Norris, assuring him that he had done everything he could and had held Hattie during the worst part, but that he needed to let her go because he needed to be treated. Once he let go, Hattie was taken onto another gurney so Meredith could declare her dead. However, Meredith found a pulse and the doctors took Hattie to another room to continue to work on her.\n\nNorris had a fracture in his leg and internal injuries. He was taken from the ER into surgery, where Meredith repaired his internal injuries, which included an avulsed spleen, while [[Callie Torres|Callie]] performed a fasciotomy on his leg.\n\nPost-op, Norris and Hattie were reunited. They were both stable. When Hattie found out what Norris had done for her, she said it was stupid.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nNorris is married to [[Harriet Straughn]]. He loved her so much that even when he was told that she was dead, he wouldn't let go of her.\n\n===Familial===\nNorris and Hattie have one daughter, [[Sarah Straughn|Sarah]]. Sarah is a recovering drug addict who attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings in [[Seattle]].\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 69 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n11x07-6.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Straughn, Norris}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S11 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (General)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
