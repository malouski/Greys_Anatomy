While they were there, she had a crush on him and he used this to get her to do all his homework for him. At one point, he implied that he'd take her to Homecoming, but didn't end up inviting her.\n\n===Bus Crash===\nMarcus was taking a group of high schoolers on a tour of colleges when the bus they were in slid down an embankment. He was taken to the ER, where his only complaint was cuts on his arm. Bailey stitched up his arm, but then [[George O'Malley]] asked her to listen to his heart. She did and then called for a cardio consult.\n\n[[Erica Hahn]] listened to his heart and heard atrial fibrillation and prescribed blood thinners and an outpatient workup because he wasn't symptomatic. However, he later had a cardiac episode. He had a ventricular septal defect. They took him into surgery to repair the defect.\n\nAfter his surgery, he thanked Bailey, saying he wouldn't have made it through the day without her. Marcus then proceeded to ask her if she had finished doing his paperwork, making Bailey realize that he was taking advantage of her.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nWhen he was in high school, Miranda Bailey was his tutor. Because she had a serious crush on him, she ended up doing most of his homework for him. When he came into the hospital as an adult, he talked her into doing all his paperwork for him.\n\n==Career==\nHe works at a high school. Part of his job involved taking a set of students on a tour of colleges.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 34 at the time of the accident.\n*He ran track in high school.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n4x08-1.jpg\n4x08-2.jpg\n4x08-3.JPG\n4x08-4.jpg\n4x08-5.JPG\n4x08-8.JPG\n4x08-9.jpg\n4x08-10.jpg\n4x08-12.jpg\n4x08-20.jpg\n4x08-21.jpg\n4x08-22.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:King, Marcus}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Cardio)]]"}}}]}}}}
