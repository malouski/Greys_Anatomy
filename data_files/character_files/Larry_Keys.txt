April told someone he needed a chest x-ray, but the post-it with his status on it was lost on someone's shoe. When they found him, he was struggling to breathe and blood was coming through his trach. He was intubated with difficulty and then taken into surgery.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keys, Larry}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]"}}}]}}}}
