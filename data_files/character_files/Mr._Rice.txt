Her parents believed she had just gotten an infection from her trip, but when she was examined, four scars were present on her abdomen. She wouldn't say what they were from, but her scans revealed that she'd had gastric bypass and it was done poorly. She had an abscess and swelling in her bowel. They did the surgery and reversed the bypass, but they had to remove a large portion of her bowel, meaning she'd struggle to get proper nutrition for the rest of her life.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe is married to [[Tina Rice]] and they have a daughter together.\n\n===Familial===\nHis daughter, Claire, struggled to be perfect under the pressure from his wife.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rice, Mr.}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S1 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
