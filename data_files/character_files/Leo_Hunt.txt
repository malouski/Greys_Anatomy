''(\"[[Judgment Day]]\")''\n\nOwen took him in for his six month checkup. His birth mother, Betty, came to the exam. After Amelia offered to take her in, Betty ended up coming home with her, Owen, and Leo. ''(\"[[Bad Reputation]]\")''\n\nWhen Betty's parents came to the hospital looking for her, they found out about Leo. They decided they'd take him, but Owen said as he was Leo's legal guardian, he'd be fighting them. ''(\"[[I Walk the Line]]\")''\n\n===COVID-19 Pandemic===\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Leo and his sister, Allison, were left in the care of their grandmother as both their parents were working at the hospital with COVID patients. During this time, Leo occasionally FaceTimed with Teddy and Owen. ''(\"[[Helplessly Hoping]]\")'' He and his grandma made up a game during this time in which she wrapped him with pillows and he pretended he was sleeping on a cloud. ''(\"[[In My Life]]\")''\n\n===Play Date===\nZola, Bailey, Ellis, Leo, Allison, and Scout all had a play date together with Teddy and Amelia supervising. They spent most of the day outside, playing on their play set. At the end of the day, Owen came over and told Zola that they'd taken Meredith off the ventilator and she was breathing on her own. Zola happily spread the information to the other kids. ''(\"[[Breathe]]\")''\n\n===Christmas===\nMeredith, Amelia, Link, Owen, and Teddy spent Christmas together with all their children. At this celebration, Owen proposed to Teddy for the second time and she accepted.\n\n===Maggie and Winston's Wedding===\nIn April 2021, Leo attended Maggie and Winston's wedding with Teddy and Owen. ''(\"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\")''\n\n===Teddy and Owen's Wedding===\nLeo came to the park with Teddy and Owen on the day they were meant to get married. The wedding was interrupted by a bicycle accident, but they later got married at [[Emerald City Bar]]. ''(\"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis birth father is a drug dealer. His birth mother became addicted to drugs after receiving opioids for an ACL repair. She ran away from her parents, who did not know about her pregnancy. Leo was fostered by [[Owen Hunt]] until the birth mother's parents found out about Leo's existence. They wanted to raise Leo but soon came to realize they had to focus on their daughter and let her be a child. The family then agreed to let Owen and Amelia adopt Leo. Owen and Amelia split up shortly before the adoption, so Owen adopted Leo on his own with Amelia choosing to stay a big part of Leo's life as \"Auntie\u00a0Amelia\".\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He has a stuffed tiger\u00a0named Roodle.\n*His last name was confirmed to have been changed from Nelson to Hunt through an X-ray shown in [[A Hard Pill to Swallow]].\n*He swallowed his\u00a0stepmother's engagement ring when she dropped it in his oatmeal.\n*He gets carsick.<ref>[[Breathe]], 17x10</ref>\n*He is portrayed by twin girls despite his character being a boy.\n*He shows signs of gender nonconformity as he likes tutus<ref>[[Here Comes the Sun]], 18x01</ref> and dresses.<ref>[[Some Kind of Tomorrow]], 18x02</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episodic===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\" crop=\"true\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n14x20Leo.png|[[Judgment Day]]\n14x21Leo.png|[[Bad Reputation]]\n14x22Leo.png|[[Fight For Your Mind]]\n14x23Leo.png|[[Cold as Ice]]\n15x01Leo.png|[[With a Wonder and a Wild Desire]]\n15x04LeoNelson.png|[[Momma Knows Best]]\n15x05LeoNelson.png|[[Everyday Angel]]\n15x06LeoNelson.png|[[Flowers Grow Out of My Grave]]\n15x08LeoNelson.png|[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\n15x09LeoNelson.png|[[Shelter from the Storm]]\n15x12LeoNelson.png|[[Girlfriend in a Coma]]\n15x13LeoNelson.png|[[I Walk the Line]]\n15x14LeoNelson.png|[[I Want a New Drug]]\n15x15LeoNelson.png|[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\n15x16LeoNelson.png|[[Blood and Water]]\n15x20LeoNelson.png|[[The Whole Package]]\n15x21LeoNelson.png|[[Good Shepherd]]\n15x22LeoNelson.png|[[Head Over High Heels]]\n15x23LeoNelson.png|[[What I Did for Love]]\n15x24LeoNelson.png|[[Drawn to the Blood]]\n15x25LeoNelson.png|[[Jump Into the Fog]]\n16x01LeoHunt.png|[[Nothing Left to Cling To]]\n16x04LeoHunt.png|[[It's Raining Men]]\n16x06LeoHunt.png|[[Whistlin' Past the Graveyard]]\n16x11LeoHunt.png|[[A Hard Pill to Swallow]]\n16x21LeoHunt.png|[[Put on a Happy Face]]\n17x07LeoHunt.png|[[Helplessly Hoping]]\n17x10LeoHunt.png|[[Breathe]]\n17x17LeoHunt.png|[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]\n18x01LeoHunt.png|[[Here Comes the Sun]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n15x01-1.jpg\n15x14-10.jpg\n15x14-12.jpg\n17x17-19.jpg\n18x02-19.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Leo Hunt Appearances}}\n\n{{Template:Scrollbox}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hunt, Leo}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S14 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S15 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S16 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S17 Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S18 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (Peds)]]"}}}]}}}}
