It took the paramedics a while to get him out of the truck and to the hospital. He had severe crush injuries and was impaled on himself.\n\nCallie thought she'd have to amputate the leg, but after they unimpaled him, he woke up and said that because he's homeless, he can't live without his leg. In order to get him to agree to have surgery, Callie developed a plan to save his legs by replacing the bones with titanium rods.\n\nAfter Owen and Derek spoke to him about how he was smart to have been able to survive for so long on the streets, he agreed to have the surgery.\n\nThey took him into surgery and started to work. They were able to repair a lot of the damage, but he coded and was pronounced dead in the OR.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was pronounced dead at 19:22.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n5x08-7.jpg\n5x08-8.jpg\n5x08-31.jpg\n5x08-32.jpg\n5x08-34.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miller, Timothy}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Ortho)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]"}}}]}}}}
