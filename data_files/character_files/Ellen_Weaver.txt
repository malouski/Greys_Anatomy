Dr. Pierce examined him and ruled out a heart attack and aortic dissection, so she handed his case off to Dr. Bailey, who began to run tests to find out the cause. Jeremy was in a rush to get out of the hospital as quickly as possible so he could get back to work, so he agreed to skip a less invasive test and go straight to esophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, the EGD revealed a large tumor, which the doctors determined to be adenocarcinoma. His diet caused severe acid reflux, which made his esophagus the perfect breeding ground for cancer. They planned an esophagectomy, which involved removing part of his esophagus along with the tumor and replacing it with part of his colon. However, shortly after they started his surgery, he coded and was unable to be resuscitated.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nShe was married to [[Jeremy Weaver]] until his death.\n\n===Familial===\nShe and her husband have one daughter, [[Erin Weaver]].
