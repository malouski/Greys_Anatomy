He lay down in his usual bed in the ER and insisted that Bailey run tests, which she said she wouldn't do because she didn't believe anything was wrong with him. Suddenly, a gunshot rang out and Mr. Nelligan's leg began to bleed profusely. He was taken to a trauma room, where they learned he had a femoral bleed, so he was taken into surgery to repair it. After his surgery, he was told he would need to return in a month for a follow-up, but he said he'd never be coming back to the hospital and asked to have his records sent over to [[Seattle Presbyterian Hospital]]. ''(\"[[Come on Down to My Boat, Baby]]\")''\n\nHe later went to Seattle Pres claiming he had a pre-clot in his leg. He was told he couldn't be admitted for a pre-clot, despite his insistence that it was serious. ''(\"[[(Don't Fear) the Reaper]]\")''\n\n===Covid-19===\nIn the early days of Covid-19, Mr. Nelligan came to station 19 hoping to get a test. However, he was told the tests were only for people with symptoms. He tried to say his throat was closing up, but Andy simply told him to go to the hospital. He declined, saying he thought he'd get Covid there. She suggested instead just staying home and keeping his distance from others.
