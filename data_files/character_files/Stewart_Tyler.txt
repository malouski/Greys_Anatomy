He was very drunk and while the doctors were discussing the best course of action to pull out the knife, he had his friend pull it out. Because he didn't have any serious bleeding or signs of more serious injury and was eager to leave, they discharged him against medical advice. Jackson advised him to keep a lookout for any signs of further damage and put him in a cab.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Friendships===\nHe is friends with [[Dave]], who came to the hospital with him after he was stabbed.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tyler, Stewart}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
