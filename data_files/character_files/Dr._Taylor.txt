However, Taylor appealed to Derek to kick George out of the OR, which he did. \u00a0Derek told Taylor that he \"better be ready\" and Taylor said he was. After Cristina replaced George in the surgery, Derek noticed that Jamie's anesthesia was getting light and that she was waking up. \u00a0Cristina then realized that Taylor was asleep. \u00a0After waking up, he corrected the anesthesia only to be ordered to leave by Shepherd and be replaced with Dr. Pennington.\n\n===Izzie's Party===\nHe attended the [[Izzie's Meet-the-Boyfriend Get Together|party]] Izzie threw for her boyfriend. At the party, he made out with his ex-girlfriend, [[Debbie]]. ''(\"[[Notes from the Nurses' Station]]\")''\n\n==Relationships==\n===Romantic===\nHe dated [[Debbie]] for a time. They bonded over doing crosswords together in the OR and he eventually used a crossword joke to ask her out on a date. Things broke off between them because she didn't like that he didn't like to do anything that didn't involve alcohol. After they split, she kept being drawn to him, even though she knew it was a bad idea.
