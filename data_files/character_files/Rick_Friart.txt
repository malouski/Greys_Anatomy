The fingers were brought in, so after they stabilized him, they talked about trying to re-attach them. The cuts were clean, so re-attachment looked good. Derek said that it would be a hard recovery, with months of rehab to get function back. He asked Rick if he smoked, as that could affect the grafts. Rick denied it, but Cristina spotted nicotine stains on his fingers and revealed that he was lying.\n\nCristina prepped Rick for surgery, but he got the impression that she didn't think he could quit smoking like he said he would. Derek heard about this and told Cristina that if Rick didn't believe he could quit, he wouldn't, so he needed Cristina to go apologize and say it was about her, not him.\n\nCristina went to apologize, but found him trying to get a candy bar out of a vending machine. She led him back to his room and apologized, but he said it made him think. He didn't want to end up the guy in a bar with a stump for hand talking about how he used to be a great musician. But he didn't know his last cigarette would be his last cigarette. Cristina then took him outside to have his last ever cigarette before his surgery.\n\nRick was awake during his surgery and he asked to watch because he wanted to see everything he'd screw up if he decided to smoke again.\n\nAfter his surgery, he wanted a cigarette, but Cristina was confident he'd make it through the day.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Familial===\nHis dad has a combover and a wife named Kimberly whom Rick describes as annoying.\n\n==Career==\nRick is a guitarist in a band.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*He was 29 at the time of his hospitalization.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Friart, Rick}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Patients]]\n[[Category:Patients (ER)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Neuro)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Trauma)]]\n[[Category:Patients (Plastics)]]"}}}]}}}}
