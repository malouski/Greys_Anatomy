She had a plan to use the peritoneum for vaginoplasties. Because she wanted herself to be the first patient to receive the surgery, she asked them to participate. Jackson took some persuasion, but eventually agreed to participate and they submitted a proposal, which was accepted for the next round. ''(\"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\")''\n\nShe later returned to the hospital for her surgery. When she sensed tension between Jackson and Catherine, she said they needed to work it out before her surgery, because she didn't want to go under the knife until she had their full attention. They assured her they had it sorted out, so she went to have surgery, but when they fought in the scrub room, she went back to her room. They followed her to convince her not to leave and eventually worked out their issue. Then she agreed to have the surgery. It went well and Michelle was awake afterward.
