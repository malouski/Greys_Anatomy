Despite not finding the cause of the patient's pain, and finding that the tests Bailey suggested all had negative results, Baylow sent the patient home. When the patient returned months later, she immediately chose to rush the patient for exploratory surgery, but Bailey canceled it, informing Baylow that the patient was misdiagnosed.\n\nBailey then inappropriately scolded Baylow, much to Baylow's chagrin. Fortunately, Chief [[Richard Webber|Webber]] was there and pulled Bailey into his office. He then seemingly reprimanded Bailey as Baylow witnessed this from the catwalk and gossiped to her friends and colleagues. Baylow was unaware that Webber was actually praising Bailey. Alicia was then started on hemin to treat her porphyria and Baylow and Bailey checked on her.\n\n==Career==\nNicole Baylow was a [[General Surgery|surgical]] [[Resident|resident]] at [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. She was the resident supervisor for [[Miranda Bailey]]. Despite being in the program longer, Baylow was a nominal surgeon who had little regard for patient history and took credit for ideas generated by her interns.\n\n==Notes and Trivia==\n*Baylow disparaged [[Miranda Bailey|Miranda's]] name when the latter introduced herself as \"Mandy\".\n\n==Gallery==\n===Episode Stills===\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" position=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" bordersize=\"none\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\n6x15-3.jpg\n6x15-4.jpg\n6x15-11.jpg\n6x15-14.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baylow, Nicole}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:GA Characters]]\n[[Category:GA S6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]"}}}]}}}}
